# Assassination

## Overview

Number of Players: 2

Special Components: Planet Token (flipped to its verdant Class M side)

Captains from several Federation ships are on a diplomatic mission to a newly discovered Class M planet. The Klingons are using the opportunity to covertly eliminate several of the Federation's commands at the same time.

## Set Up

__Federation Player__
: 70 squadron points, which must include at least one Federation Ship.

__Klingon player__
: 70 squadron points, which must include at least one D7 Class ship and at least one crew upgrade.

The ships are set up as a standard 2-Player Game. In addition, place the Planet Token in the center of the Klingon side, 8" from the Klingon edge.

The Federation player must place 1 Mission Token on each of his Captain Cards. The Captains are considered to be on the planet and the Federation player's ships have a Skill of 1 until their Captains are returned.

The Captains must beam aboard their own ships using the special rules described on the Special Rules Card. While on the plant, the Captains cannot be targeted by any cards or effects other than those listed on the Special Rules Card.

## Special Rules

All of the Klingon ships have the following Actions in addition to their normal abilities:

__ACTION__: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and target a planet at Range 1 or a ship at Range 1-2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Then, place a Mission Token on one of your Crew Upgrades and another Mission Token on top of the related planet or Ship Card. This Crew Upgrade becomes an assassin and is now considered to be on the planet or on board the targeted ship. It cannot be used for any other purpose and cannot have additional Mission Tokens assigned to it.

__ACTION__: If your ship is not cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and target a planet ar Range 1 with a Mission Token in it, or a ship at Range 1-2 with a Mission Token on its Ship Card that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Remove your Mission Token from that planet or Ship Card, and then remove the Mission Token from your Crew Upgrade. That Crew member has now beamed back aboard your ship and is no longer considered an assassin.

The Klingon player may have any number of assassins on the same planet or enemy ship.

During the End Phase, if the Federation player still has at least 1 Captain left on the planet, the Klingon player rolls 1 attack die for each of his Mission Tokens on the planet. On a critical result, the Klingon player has assassinated one Captain of his choice on the planet and wins the game.

Also during the End Phase, if the Klingon player has at least 1 Mission Token on an enemy Ship Card that has its Captain back aboard, the Klingon player rolls 1 attack die for each of his Mission Tokens on that Ship Card. On a Critical Hit, the Klingon player has assassinated that Captain and wins the game.

Federation Captains: Each Federation ship within Range 1 of the Planet Token gains the following Action:

__ACTION__: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields to remove the Mission Token from your Captain Card. That Captain has now beamed back aboard his ship and may use his Skill Number as normal.

Planet Token: The Planet Token follows the same rules for obstructing movement and firing as detailed on page 22 of the Star Trek: Attack Wing Starter Set Rules of Play.

### Objective

__Klingon Player__: Assassinate one of the Deferation Captains or destroy one of the Federation ships.

__Federation Player__: Beam all of your Captains up to their respective ships and enter warp by moving all of your ships through your starting area and off the board. If one of your ships leaves the edge othe table while still having a Mission Token on its Captains, you fail the mission and lose the game. Also, if one of your ships leaves the table without going through its starting area, you lose the game.

# The Kobayashi Maru

## Mission Overview

Number of Players: 2

Special Components: 12 Mission Tokens, plus the Objective Token from the base set with the Derelict Ship image on its reverse side. This token should be flipped over to its Derelict Ship Side. It will be referred to from now as the Kobayashi Maru Token.

You are attempting to overcome the infamous Kobayashi Maru scenario as part of your training at Starfleet Academy. During the simulation, you receive a distress call from the Kobayashi Maru, a fuel carrier that has become disabled in the Klingon Neutral Zone. You must rescue the crew and escape before aggressive Klingon warships destroy your ship.

## Set Up

__Klingon player__
: 80 squadron points, which must include at least one Klingon Ship.

__Federation Player__
: 50 squadron points, which must include exactly one ship (Constitution Class) plus one Captain and any number of purchased Upgrades.

The ships are set up as a standard 2-Player Game.

In addition, the Kobayashi Maru Token is placed in the center of the Klingon Side, 12‚Äù from the Klingon edge. This token represents the Kobayashi Maru. It is considered an Obstacle and follows the normal rules for Obstacles on page 22 of the Star Trek: Attack Wing Starter Set Rules of Play.

## Special Rules

### Objective

Federation Player: Your ship has 9 rounds to acquire 3 Mission Tokens and then enter warp by crossing your starting edge. Use Mission Tokens to mark the passing of time. If your ship leaves the edge of the table without having 3 Mission Tokens on its Ship Card, you fail the mission and lose the game. Also, if your ship leaves the table without going through your starting area, you lose the game.

Klingon player: Prevent the Federation ship from completing its Mission in 9 rounds.

While the Federation Ship is within Range 1-2 of the Objective Token, it can perform the following Action:

**Action:** If your ship is no Cloaked, disable all your remaining Shields to beam aboard survivors. Place 1 Mission Token on top of your Ship Card.
Note: This mission is strongly weighted in favor of the Klingon player. The Federation player must face this difficult mission with dignity and display his or her strength of character throughout.
