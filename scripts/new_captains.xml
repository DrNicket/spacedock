    <Ability>When a [CREW] Upgrade on an enemy ship within Range 1-2 of your ship performs an Action that would affect your ship, you may disable this card to prevent that Action from taking effect. If you do this, the enemy ship cannot take another Action that round. If the enemy [CREW] Upgrade was disabled to perform the Action, it remains disabled. If the enemy [CREW] Upgrade was discarded to perform the Action, disable it instead.</Ability>
