    <Title>Thought Maker</Title>
    <Ability>During the Planning Phase, after every ship has been assigned a Maneuver Dial, you may discard this card to target a ship within Range 1-2.  If you do so, look at that ship's Maneuver Dial and change it to any of its 1 or 2 Green Maneuvers (your choice).  That Maneuver Dial cannot be changed nor can its player look at it until it is that ship's turn to activate.  The target ship's player may place an Auxiliary Power Token beside the target ship to ignore the new Maneuver and not move that round.  This Upgrade may only be purchased for a Ferengi ship.</Ability>
