This is the preliminary FAQ to help people who are participating in tournaments during the coming weeks. This will eventually be replaced with a more formal FAQ in PDF format, but for now I want to keep it fluid and easy to update. To help the FAQ not get lost in a sea of new threads, I will link up to it in the "More Information" section on the main ST: AW page here on BGG.<br/><br/><br/><b>UPDATE (1/14/14):</font></b> All updates are in red.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>SPECIAL REQUESTS:</font><br/><br/>• <b>NEW SEARCHABLE PAGE!</b></font> Please use the following searchable page (created by Rob Tsuk) to search for your topic to see if it has already been answered:<br/><br/><pre>     <a href="http://spacedock.funnyhatsoftware.com/full_faq.html" target="_blank" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">ST:AW SEARCHABLE FAQ THREAD</a></pre><br/><br/>• Try to word your questions so that they require "yes" or "no" responses when possible.<br/><br/>• When asking multiple questions, please try to number them and avoid asking more than one question per number.<br/><br/>• When asking questions about a particular card, please quote the card text right in your post.<br/><br/>• Please do not send rules questions (or spoiler requests) to me privately. I prefer to help as many players as I can with my answers.<br/><br/>• If someone gives the correct answer to a question, I will give them a "Thumbs Up" to verify that their answer is correct.</b><br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>GENERAL</b><br/><br/><b>1. If I have a Ship, Captain, Upgrade, or Damage Card that uses the word "you", does it refer to that specific ship or to all of your ships?</b><br/><br/>As mentioned on page 21 of the Full Rules (under "Card Abilities"), abilities on Ship Cards, Captain Cards, Upgrade Cards, and Damage Cards only affect the ship to which they are assigned, unless otherwise specified.<br/><br/><b>2. When Squad Building, is there a penalty for including ships of different Factions in the same Fleet?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>3. When I perform the Cloak Action, do I disable <i>all</i> of my remaining Shield Tokens, or do I get to keep one Shield Token Active?</b><br/><br/>You must disable <b>all</b> of your remaining Shield Tokens.<br/><br/><b>4. If two ships' bases are touching each other, do those ships ignore considerations of firing arc when attacking each other?</b><br/><br/>No. The rule on page 18 is simply meant to convey that ships can attack each other as normal when their bases are touching. The ships must still obey the firing arc requirements in order to target each other during the Combat Phase.<br/><br/><b>5. If a ship overlaps another ship or obstacle, can it still perform free Actions?</b><br/><br/>No. A ship that loses the ability to perform Actions also loses the ability to perform free Actions, including free Actions granted outside the ship's Perform Actions step.<br/><br/><b>6. Can I voluntarily disable my Shields at any time (i.e. without using card text)?</b><br/><br/>No. However, if you de-Cloak during the End Phase, you can choose to not raise your Shields afterwards.<br/><br/><b>7. Can I voluntarily de-Cloak at any time (i.e. outside of the End Phase)?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>8. Does the term "friendly" on a card ever refer to the ship on which the card is located?</b><br/><br/>No, the term "friendly" only refers to other ships in your fleet.<br/><br/><b>9. When a card ability allows a player to gain a certain number of attack or defense dice "this round" (for example, Scotty), how does this work?</b><br/><br/>For attack dice, this allows the player to add that many attack dice (in total) to his attack rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If a player is able to make multiple attacks during the same Combat Phase, the player may choose when to add the bonus attack dice. These dice can even be added to Secondary Weapon attacks.<br/><br/>For defense dice, this allows the player to add that many defense dice (in total) to his defense rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If the player is attacked multiple times during the same Combat Phase, the player can choose when to add the bonus defense dice.<br/><br/>Note that this type of text is different from a continuous bonus which does not use the phrase "this round" (for example, the text on Donatra or Terrell). A continuous bonus applies to all attack and defense rolls made by the affected ships during that round.<br/><br/><b>10. When a card ability forces a player to roll fewer attack or defense dice "this round" (for example, Kyle), how does that work?</b><br/><br/>The player <b>must</b> roll fewer attack or defense dice in total during that round's Combat Phase, starting with the very next time the player uses those dice during the Combat Phase.<br/><br/><b>11. If a ship moves onto or through an Obstacle, can it perform any Actions later during the round?</b><br/><br/>No, a ship moving onto or through an Obstacle skips its Perform Actions step and also cannot perform additional Actions that round, such as through the use of Martok.<br/><br/><b>12. If a ship moves onto or through an Obstacle, can it still perform card text that does not require an Action (for example, can Martok still grant a free Action to another ship)?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>13. When checking to see if a ship's attack is blocked by a planet or other obstruction, should you lay the Range Ruler flat or on its edge?</b><br/><br/>For the purposes of this rule, the line separating the two ships is considered infinitely thin, so lay the Range Ruler on its edge for greater accuracy.<br/><br/><b>14. If an ability takes place after a ship moves, when precisely does this ability trigger?</b><br/><br/>It triggers after Step 5 (Clean Up) of the ship's Activation Phase, before its Perform Action step.<br/><br/><b>15. If an attacking ship has somehow managed to acquire multiple Scan Tokens (e.g. Romulan Pilot, Captain Janeway), does the defender roll 1 less defense die for each Scan Token?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>16. If one of my own cards requires me to "discard" or "disable" the card in order to activate its special ability, can I choose when to use this card (e.g. Worf (Starter), Uhura, McCoy)?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>17. Is it possible for a ship to perform the Cloak Action and the Sensor Echo Action in the same round (e.g. through the use of Martok)?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>18. In general, when can a ship perform a "free Action"?</b><br/><br/>If a card grants a free Action to a ship but does not specify when the free Action can be performed, the ship must perform the free Action during its Perform Actions step.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>SHIP CARDS</b><br/><br/><b>1. When the Enterprise-D uses its special ability, is it considered to be using its Primary Weapon? If so, does that mean it gains +1 attack die at Range 1?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>2. If the Valdore performs two Green Maneuvers during the same Activation Phase, does it receive its attack bonus twice?</b><br/><br/>No. The Valdore's text only checks to see if you have performed at least one Green Maneuver.<br/><br/><b>3. If the Kraxon uses its ability to absorb damage, can it trigger the text on its Counter Attack Upgrade? If the Kraxon only absorbs part of the damage received by my other ship, can both the Kraxon and that other ship trigger the text on their separate Counter Attack Upgrades?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>4. If Antimatter Mines are dropped on top of the Defiant, is it still considered to be "defending," even though it does not roll any defense dice?</b><br/><br/>Yes. However, this is not the case when the Defiant moves into mines (Antimatter or Cloaked) on a later turn.<br/><br/><b>5. Can the Rav Laerst's special Sensor Echo text be augmented by Synon?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>CAPTAIN CARDS</b><br/><br/><b>1. If a Captain is disabled for any reason, what is the Skill Number of his ship?</b><br/><br/>A ship with a disabled Captain has a Skill Number of 1. (It is assumed that a minor crew member has taken over for him.)<br/><br/><b>2. If James T. Kirk is on a non-Federation ship, must he pay +1 for his face down Federation Elite Talent Upgrades?</b><br/><br/>Yes, his ability changes the printed cost to 3, but does not exclude his Elite Talent Upgrades from the Faction Penalty.<br/><br/><b>3. Does Clark Terrell's ability add +1 defense die to his own ship, or just his allies' ships?</b><br/><br/>Clark Terrell does not add +1 defense die to his own ship.<br/><br/><b>4. Can the effect of Riker's Action trigger multiple times during the same round?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>5. If Martok's ship uses an ability that provides an additional maneuver, is this considered an extra "move" for purposes of triggering Martok's card text? (Negh'Var version)</b><br/><br/>No. When a Captain or Upgrade refers to a "move," it is only referring to the ship's initial movement for the turn. It does not apply to any bonus maneuvers that the ship might perform during the turn.<br/><br/><b>6. Does Martok's ability allow him to add +1 attack to his own ship, or just his allies' ships? (OP KIT 2 version)</b><br/><br/>Martok's ability does not affect his own ship.<br/><br/><b>7. If a Captain is disabled by Chang (or a similar effect) and has his or her Captain Skill reduced to "1", does that Captain potentially lose his or her chance to become the next active ship during the Activation Phase?</b><br/><br/>No. That ship is now considered the ship with "the next lowest Captain Skill".<br/><br/><b>8. If a Captain is disabled by Chang (or a similar effect), can that Captain's ship spend an Action to remove the Disabled Token? If so, can the Captain immediately use his or her card text?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes. Note that this is particularly good for Picard (since he can now perform a free Action) but does nothing for Martok (Negh'Var version) since Martok's text can only be used after he moves (i.e. <i>before</i> he takes an Action).<br/><br/><b>9. Can Mirok be used to repair critical damage? If so, can he repair any face up Damage Card of his choice before repairing normal damage?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>10. Does Gul Dukat allow you to perform an Evade or Battle Stations Action on a ship that does not have these Actions in its Action Bar?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>11. Can Captain Sulu disable a Crew Upgrade that is already disabled?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>12. What happens when two opposing players activate Romulan Commander during the same round?</b></font><br/><br/>If both players activate Romulan Commander, then it's up to initiative to determine which Captain fires first. If both players have the same SP and same ship Faction, then it's up to a die roll. If this happens multiple times during a game, then you roll the dice each time. It's different than the normal "roll at the start of the game and it counts for the whole game" rule because the situation generates "ex nihilo" each time it happens.<br/><br/>And of course, the "Simultaneous Attack Rule" applies when two Romulan Commanders shoot at each other.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><b>ELITE TALENT UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. If a Captain is disabled for any reason, can his ship still use Elite Talent Upgrades?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>2. Can the effect of Counter Attack trigger multiple times during the same round?</b><br/><br/>No. However, a player may choose to not trigger the effect if he wishes (e.g. to use the effect against a ship firing later in the round).<br/><br/><b>3. After playing Cheat Death, how many Damage Cards should my ship still have?</b><br/><br/>Your ship will have a number of Damage Cards equal to your Hull Value - 1. In other words, Cheat Death effectively puts you at 1 damage point away from destruction.<br/><br/><b>4. If I play Cheat Death after my ship is instantly destroyed (e.g. Warp Core Breach, Suicide Attack), what happens?</b><br/><br/>In this case you would <b><i>add</i></b> Damage Cards one at a time until the number of Damage Cards is equal to your Hull Value - 1. All face up Damage Cards would still be flipped face down as per the card's text.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>CREW UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. Can Data's ship perform an Evasive Maneuvers Action <i>before</i> using Data's Action (for example, by using Picard)?</b><br/><br/>No, Data's Action cannot be used during the same turn his ship uses the Evasive Maneuvers Action.<br/><br/><b>2. Does Sulu's bonus to Agility affect each of your defense rolls during that round?</b><br/><br/>Yes. Sulu adds to the ship's Agility score, which has more lasting effects than simply adding a set number of dice that round.<br/><br/><b>3. Can a ship with multiple Tactical Officers re-roll the attack dice several times (one for each Tactical Officer)?</b><br/><br/>No, because that would be a case of more than one Upgrade triggering off the same Target Lock token (see "Upgrade Card Abilities and Action Tokens," page 22).<br/><br/><b>4. When exactly does the Romulan Pilot's text trigger?</b><br/><br/>It triggers right after Step 5 (Clean Up) of the Activation Phase, before the ship's Perform Action step.<br/><br/><b>5. Is the Romulan Pilot's free Action considered a "Scan Action"? If not, can it be performed in addition to a Scan Action?</b><br/><br/>It is not considered a Scan Action and can be performed in addition to a regular Scan Action. This would allow a ship to have 2 Scan Tokens, each independently affecting enemy ships attacked that round.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>WEAPON UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. If I spend my Target Lock to fire a Secondary Weapon (such as a Photon Torpedo), can I also use my Target Lock to re-roll attack dice?</b><br/><br/>No. Keep in mind that the Gor Portas' text presents an exception to his rule.<br/><br/><b>2. If my ship does not possess a rear firing arc, can I still fire a Torpedo from the rear of my ship if the Torpedo specifies it can be fired from the forward or rear firing arcs?</b><br/><br/>No. As per page 20 of the full rules of play, you must actually possess a rear firing arc to fire a Torpedo from the aft section of your ship.<br/><br/><b>3. If a Ship, Captain or Upgrade provides a bonus to my attack, does this apply to my Secondary Weapons as well?</b><br/><br/>Yes, unless specified otherwise.<br/><br/><b>4. Can I choose to fire the Forward Weapons Grid at only 1 enemy ship?</b><br/><br/>No, you cannot fire the Forward Weapons Grid unless there are at least two different enemy ships in your forward firing arc.<br/><br/><b>5. If my ship has an Energy Dampening Token (due to the Breen's Energy Dissipator), is my ship still considered to be performing a Straight White 1 Maneuver on the following turn? Would this allow me to perform an Action such as the one on the Cochraine Deceleration Maneuver afterwards?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>6. Does the Minefield Token follow the normal rules for Obstacles?</b><br/><br/>No. The Minefield Token is keyed to the text on the related Weapon Upgrade and does not add an additional die of damage or cause the loss of an Action like a normal Obstacle does. However, as per the rulebook on p. 23, the Minefield <i>does</i> obstruct fire like a normal Obstacle.<br/><br/><b>7. Must the Antimatter Mines be placed entirely within the Range 1 portion of my rear firing arc?</b><br/><br/>No, the Antimatter Mines can be placed anywhere that is at least partially in the Range 1 portion of your rear firing arc.<br/><br/><b>8. After firing the Antimatter Mines, does the Minefield Token remain in the play area for the duration of the game?</b> <br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>9. Can the attack dice rolled for Antimatter Mines be modified in any way?</b><br/><br/>Yes, but only when you drop the Minefield Token directly on top of another ship. In this case, the <b>number</b> of attack dice can be altered by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra. Special Upgrade powers that modify dice (such as Spock and Drex) are also effective in this case, and you may also substitute the Elite Attack Die for one of the normal attack dice. However, since the Antimatter Mines are a special form of attack that do not follow the normal rules of the Combat Phase, you cannot use Target Lock or Battle Stations tokens to modify the attack dice (and your opponent cannot use Evade tokens to cancel hits).<br/><br/>If a ship later moves onto or through an already placed Minefield Token, the dice cannot be altered at all, even by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra.<br/><br/><b>10. Must I place my Cloaked Mines at the start of the Planning Phase, or can I wait until after everyone has set their Maneuver Dials?</b><br/><br/>You place your Cloaked Mines at the start of the Planning Phase. This does not mean that other players can negate your ability to use the Cloaked Mines by quickly placing their Maneuver Dials. It simply means that after you place your Cloaked Mines, your opponents are free to alter their Maneuver Dials.<br/><br/><b>11. If the trigger areas for two Cloaked Mines overlap, does an enemy ship passing through the overlapping trigger area sustain damage from both Cloaked Mines?</b><br/><br/>No. In this case the ship would only be damaged by one of the Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/>However, if a ship passes through (and completely out of) the trigger area of one Cloaked Mine and into the trigger area of another Cloaked Mine, then the ship sustains damage from both Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/><b>12. If a ship starts its move within Range 1 of an enemy's Cloaked Mine, does it take damage when it moves this turn?</b><br/><br/>This works the same as the normal rules for a Minefield Token (see p. 23), just with a wider range. If the ship moves beyond the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it does <b><i>not</i></b> receive damage again this turn. But if it stays within the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it is <b><i>does</i></b> receive damage again this turn.<br/><br/><b>13. If a ship attacks normally during the Combat Phase, can it later be used to assist during a Barrage of Fire?</b><br/><br/>No. A ship cannot attack normally and participate in the Barrage of Fire during the same turn.<br/><br/><b>14. If a ship's attack is increased in some way, does this also boost its "Primary Weapon Value" for purposes of the Barrage of Fire?</b><br/><br/>No. Use the ship's printed "Primary Weapon Value." This can only be increased if the ship becomes your Flagship (OP Month 4).<br/><br/><b>15. If a Cloaked ship assists during a Barrage of Fire, must it flip its Cloak Token over to the red side?</b><br/><br/>Yes. The ship is still considered to have "fired" this turn.<br/><br/><b>16. If a ship assists during a Barrage of Fire, can it later assist another Barrage of Fire during the same Combat Phase?</b><br/><br/>No. Since Barrage of Fire is a Weapon Upgrade, the assisting ship is considered to have already participated in a Secondary Weapon attack, which is a normal attack.<br/><br/><b>17. Do Concussive Charges deal damage in addition to removing tokens?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>TECH UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. How long does the effect of the Tractor Beam last?</b><br/><br/>The Tractor Beam only lasts until the end of the current Round.<br/><br/><b>2. When precisely does the text on the Interphase Generator activate?</b><br/><br/>The Interphase Generator takes effect during Step 7 of the Combat Phase (Deal Damage). The <b>[Hit]</b> symbol should have been replaced with the word "damage." This damage cannot be cancelled by an Evade result.<br/><br/><b>3. Is Suicide Attack considered an "attack" for card text purposes?</b><br/><br/>Yes. Keep in mind that Scan, Target Lock, Evade, and Battle Stations tokens cannot be used during a Suicide Attack because it does not follow the normal Combat sequence. Moreover, a Cloaked ship does not roll +4 defense dice against a Suicide Attack because this bonus only applies during the Combat Phase.<br/><br/><b>4. Must I use the Positron Beam at the start of the Planning Phase, or can I wait until after everyone has set their Maneuver Dials?</b><br/><br/>You must use the Positron Beam at the start of the Planning Phase. This does not mean that other players can negate your ability to use the Positron Beam by quickly placing their Maneuver Dials. It simply means that after you use your Positron Beam, your opponents are free to alter their Maneuver Dials.<br/><br/><b>5. What is the exact sequence for using the Navigational Deflector against a Minefield?</b><br/><br/>The ship enters a minefield (or gets Antimatter Mines dropped on top of it). The minefield owner rolls attack dice. The ship can disable its Navigational Deflector to cancel 1 hit and roll defense dice against the remainder (no +4 bonus dice for Cloak unless it is the Combat Phase). Afterwards, the Navigational Deflector goes offline until the Disabled Token is removed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>RESOURCES</b><br/><br/><b>1. How many different Resources can I include when building my fleet?</b><br/><br/>Each player can include a maxiumum of 1 Resource when building his or her fleet.<br/><br/><b>2. How are Resources scored during tournaments?</b><br/><br/>If the winner of an Engagement completely eliminates his opponent's fleet, then he receives Fleet Points for his opponent's Resource. If the winner does not eliminate the opponent's entire fleet, he does not receive Fleet Points for his opponent's Resource.<br/><br/><b>3. Can I use more than one Command Token during the same round?</b><br/><br/>No, you may use only one Command Token during each game round.<br/><br/><b>4. When am I allowed to activate each of the different Command Tokens?</b><br/><br/>The Command Tokens are used as appropriate for the ability provided by the token.<br/><br/>• Tokens that provide a free Action are used during the ship's Perform Action step during the Activation Phase.<br/><br/>• Tokens that let you re-roll dice are used during the appropriate Modify Dice step of the Combat Phase.<br/><br/>• Tokens that are used "before rolling any of your [attack or defense] dice" are used right before rolling those dice.<br/><br/><b>5. Must I include one of each card type in order to make use of the Reinforcements Sideboard?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>6. Must I pay a Faction penalty when placing cards on the Reinforcements Sideboard?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>7. If an Upgrade has an additional cost if purchased for a ship other than the one listed on the card (e.g. Varel, Energy Dissipator), must I pay this penalty when adding the card to the Reinforcements Sideboard?</b><br/><br/>Yes, because the Upgrade is being added to the Sideboard instead of the indicated ship.<br/><br/><b>8. May I use the Reinforcements Sideboard more than once per game round?</b><br/><br/>No, you may only access the cards on the Reinforcements Sideboard once during each game round.<br/><br/><b>9. How are the cards on the Reinforcements Sideboard scored at the end of a tournament round?</b><br/><br/>The cards that start the game on the Reinforcements Sideboard are inextricably linked to the Sideboard for scoring purposes. Therefore, if a match ends in a tie, then any Sideboard cards currently on ships (or tucked under Ship Cards) do not count for scoring purposes. Any cards that started the match in play but which are now on the Reinforcements Sideboard are considered out of play as well, so they also do not count for scoring purposes.<br/><br/>If a player eliminates all of his opponent's ships, then he scores 10 points for that opponent's Reinforcements Sideboard. If a player does not eliminate his opponent's ships, then he does not score those points.<br/><br/><b>10. If Khan (Reliant version) is the Captain of a ship when a cross-faction card is placed from the Sideboard onto his ship, is an Auxiliary Power Token still placed beside the ship?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>11. When designating a non-Independent ship as an Independent Flagship, does the ship now possess both Factions? If so, does this remove Faction penalties for Independent cards placed on that ship?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes. For initiative purposes, use the ship's original printed Faction. Using an Independent Flagship also allows the use of Independent cards on a non-Independent Ship when using the United Force Admiral's Order. <br/><br/><b>12. Does the Primary Weapon bonus on a Flagship card increase the damage of the Enterprise-D's special ability?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>13. How exactly does the Independent Flagship that grants a "2nd Action listed on its Action Bar as free Action this round" work?</b><br/><br/>The Independent Flagship can only grant the free Action to a ship that has already performed exactly 1 Action (of any kind) during that round. The free Action must be from the target ship's Action Bar.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>SPACE STATIONS & STATIONARY PLATFORMS</b><br/><br/><b>1. Are Space Stations (e.g. DS9, Scenario Space Stations) and Stationary Platforms (OWPs, PDTs) considered "ships" for card text purposes?</b><br/><br/>Yes, but these "Stations" also follow several special rules as detailed below.<br/><br/><b>2. Can any special abilities allow a Station to move?</b><br/><br/>No. This also means that a Station cannot perform a Sensor Echo Action.<br/><br/><b>3. Can a Station ever have its Agility increased (e.g. Hikaru Sulu, Tom Paris)?</b><br/><br/>No, although Stations can benefit from abilities that increase overall defense dice (Cloaking, Tetryon Emissions, etc.)<br/><br/><b>4. Can a Station be damaged by Antimatter Mines?</b><br/><br/>Yes, but only during the turn that the Mines are dropped directly on the Station. A Station does <b><i>not</i></b> receive damage from Mines on subsequent turns.<br/><br/><b>5. Can a Station be designated as a Flagship using the Flagship Resource?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>6. Is it possible for a Station to remove an Auxiliary Power Token or an Energy Dampening Token?</b><br/><br/>Yes. During a Station's turn to act during the Activation Phase, it removes 1 Auxiliary Power Token or 1 Energy Dampening Token automatically at the end of Step 5 (Clean Up).<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>OP TOURNAMENT - MONTH 1</b><br/><br/><b>1. The Tournament Guidelines are contradictory regarding the number of points given to a player who receives a Bye. What is the correct amount?</b><br/><br/>A player receiving a Bye gains 2 points (not 3).<br/><br/><b>2. Can members of the Away Team use their abilities while on DS9?</b><br/><br/>No. The only information retained by the Away Team is the Captain's Skill Number.<br/><br/><b>3. Can you clarify the text regarding battles between opposing Away Teams on Deep Space 9?</b><br/><br/>The text for this is being revised for greater clarity in later OP Kits:<br/><br/><i>The player with the highest Captain Skill on DS9 rolls 1 attack die for every card that is in his Away Team; the other player rolls 1 defense die for every card that is in his Away Team. For every uncancelled [Hit] result, the defending player discards 1 Captain or [Crew] Upgrade of his choice from his Away Team. After the player with the higher Captain Skill attacks, the player with the lower Captain Skill attacks with the remaining members of his Away Team in the same way.<br/><br/>If both players have the same highest Captain Skill, then the player with initiative attacks first; however, any defeated Captains or Crew may fire back before being discarded as per the Simultaneous Attack Rule.<br/><br/>Note: If a player has no Captain on DS9, his Away Team is considered to have a Captain Skill of 1.</i><br/><br/><b>4. Can I send multiple Captains to DS9?</b><br/><br/>Yes, all of your cards (even from different ships) are part of the same Away Team. Only use the Captain Skill of your best Captain.<br/><br/><b>5. If an Away Team's ship is destroyed, what happens to the Away Team?</b><br/><br/>For purposes of the OP scenario, the Away Team survives on DS9.<br/><br/><b>6. If DS9 is destroyed, what happens to any Away Teams that are aboard it?</b><br/><br/>They are destroyed (i.e. discarded from play).<br/><br/><b>7. Can DS9 fire out of both exposed Pylons, as well as the Main Body, during the same turn? If so, what is DS9's firing arc?</b><br/><br/>Yes, DS9 can attack with both exposed Pylons and the Main Body every turn. At Range 1-2, its firing arc is in all directions. At Range 3, use the individual Pylons to determine firing arc.<br/><br/><b>8. How does using the DS9 Token work in normal battles outside the tournament?</b><br/><br/>• DS9 is not a "normal" ship, and therefore it is only allowed if both players agree to its inclusion. It is certainly not allowed in tournament play unless the scenario specifically calls for it (i.e. you can't fill out your tournament squadron with a DS9 Token!).<br/><br/>• If both players agree to permit DS9 in their game, then the players can either agree on its placement (such as in the dead center of the play area) or perhaps have the owner place it within range 2 of his starting area.<br/><br/>• Alternatively, you can decide that no player controls DS9 and place it equidistant from each Starting Area; in this case, the station costs 0 Squadron Points. Use the rules for taking control of the station from the OP Kit instructions. The main thing here is to make sure both players agree and have a good time!<br/><br/>• Each Pylon, as well as the main body of DS9, can fire independently, giving it a potential 4 attacks per round. When firing from the main body of DS9, you start measuring range from the outside edge of the token.<br/><br/>• For purposes of initiative between DS9's two visible Factions, DS9 is considered to use the Faction with the higher initiative (in this case, Federation).<br/><br/>• DS9 does not move under any circumstances, even as the result of Captain or Upgrade abilities (e.g. Gul Ranor).<br/><br/>• DS9 and all space stations used in Missions are considered "ships" for purposes of card text. However, card text that causes a space station to move is ineffective.<br/><br/>• Secondary Weapons can only be fired from the Pylons on DS9 (not from the Main Body).<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>OP TOURNAMENT - MONTH 2</b><br/><br/><b>1.

FYI: I have added a clarification for Clark Terrell (one of the Captains of the <i>Reliant</i>), who has inspired so much discussion here on the Forums. His text inadvertantly omits the word "other." It is not the intention of this card to have Terrell add +1 defense die to his own ship.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Yes, this is my fault. When we realized during blind playtests that the term "friendly" came across as ambiguous, we added the word "other" to most of those cards (such as Gowron and Donatra), but somehow we missed poor Terrell.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

I spoke to Chris G. about this, and he explained that the DS9 Token will work in the same way as the DS9 model, and in both cases a ship overlapping DS9 is considered to be <i>under</i> the model (or possibly "over" the space station in 3D conceptual space).<br/><br/>Therefore, DS9 can fire at a ship overlapping it, and this is considered a Range 1 attack. However, because DS9 is literally firing through itself (an obstacle), the defending ship receives +1 defense die. Conceptually, this represents the guns on DS9 avoiding firing at the station itself.<br/><br/>Similarly, a ship overlapping DS9 can fire at the station at Range 1, and DS9 would receive +1 defense die. Conceptually, this is because the ship is weaving around trying to avoid crashing into DS9.<br/><br/>And most importantly, there is no "pew pew" sound in space, although I realize the source material contradicts this. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/laugh.gif" alt="laugh"><br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Hi, Kenn.<br/><br/>1) Correct, if it shows a specific icon (Hit), it does not apply to another icon (Critical Hit).<br/><br/>2) Correct, the Self-Replicating Mines do different damage than normal Obstacles.<br/><br/>3) You are correct. The Khazara can keep cloaking every turn and getting that bonus. The downside to firing each turn is that, as you mentioned, you can be target locked and you must keep spending your Action every turn to re-cloak. Also, you won't have time to Sensor Echo, one of the most powerful benefits of cloaking.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

1. Yes, you can boost the number of attack dice used with Ferengi Missile Launchers.<br/><br/>2. As per the rulebook, page 13: "If the attacker and defender both have abilities that modify attack dice, the defender resolves all of his abilities before the attacker resolves any."<br/><br/>Therefore, Toreth would always be able to land a crit against the Defiant or a ship with Polarized Hull Plating.<br/><br/>3.

Another question that occurred to me: Earlier you had noted the use of Counter Attack by the Kraxon was valid if its ship ability was invoked to take damage onto its shields for a ship being attacked at Range 1. If the Kraxon does not have enough shields to completely absorb the damage, or chooses not to take all of it onto its shields, can the remaining damage to the original target ship trigger Counter Attack for that ship as well, provided both ships took an action that round to use Counter Attack? In what order are the two attacks resolved, if this is possible?<br/><br/>Kraxon: "Whenever a friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship receives damage you may transfer any amount of that damage to your own Shields, if possible."<br/><br/>Counter Attack: "Action: If your ship's Shields or Hull are damaged by a ship in your forward firing arc this round, you may immediately make 1 free attack against that ship. You may not make this attack if your ship is destroyed."</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Correct, if both ships have Counter Attack, they can both trigger its text in this instance.</div>

The Command Token is a separate bonus from the Admiral Token, so I think this is fine as long as you're not re-rolling the same die twice.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Yes it only affects the next attack.<br/><br/>The difference between EM Pulse and Tractor Beam is that EM Pulse applies if another ship attacks them. Tractor Beam only affects your ship's attack.<br/><br/>No, Riker's ability is not considered an attack.<br/><br/></div>

No (You need 2 Shields)<br/><br/>Most questions like this can be answered by reading the "Disabled Shields" section on page 19. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, if something requires you to disable a specific number of shields, you must disable that many in order to use the ability.<br/><br/>Conversely, if something requires you to disable "all remaining shields," then you don't need to have any active shields to use that ability.<br/><br/>Cloaking is an exception.

Howdy, folks.<br/><br/>After discussing with Chris Guild, I have re-evaluated my answer regarding overlapping trigger zones for Cloaked Mines. Here is the entry I added to the FAQ:<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/><b>11. If the trigger areas for two Cloaked Mines overlap, does an enemy ship passing through the overlapping trigger area sustain damage from both Cloaked Mines?</b></font><br/><br/>No. In this case the ship would only be damaged by one of the Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/>However, if a ship passes through (and completely out of) the trigger area of one Cloaked Mine and into the trigger area of another Cloaked Mine, then the ship sustains damage from both Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>Thematically, the reason why your own ships can pass safely through a Cloaked Minefield is that you are able to see their energy signature and fly in between them, which means they are purposefully set up to not be densely packed. This is the reason why the Scan Action helps mitigate the effects of a Cloaked Minefield, as it helps the enemy ship get a loose reading on the mines' locations.<br/><br/>Mechanically, it was never the intention of this card to create a zone of absolute death (which would happen if enough of them were overlapping). The intention of allowing multiples was to spread the Cloaked Minefield further out and to increase the damage to ships travelling through the multiple zones (not to annihilate a ship passing through a dense clump of them).<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Andrew<br/><br/></div>

Card text is unaffected when moving into an obstacle. You simply cannot perform Actions. Since Martok's text is not an Action, he may still use his text in this situation.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

If multiple ships, do all the ground forces token have to be "on" just one of your ships, or can you spread them out over your fleet?<br/><br/>3. If the ship the ground tokens are on gets destroyed before all the ground tokens are deployed, are those tokens lost?<br/><br/>4. Are the SAMs only triggered with the loss of your ground troops? To rephrase, can you trigger the SAMs even if you've not lost any troops in an attack exchange?<br/><br/>5. The rules text says that to place ground troops on the planet you must disable all your shields if your ship is not cloaked. Does that mean cloaked ships can't deploy troops?<br/><br/>6. At the end of a combat round resolution, if you are cloaked and the cloak doesn't have to come down because you've not fired that round, can you raise shields as part of the combat resolution so as to de-cloak? Or will you have had to attack to get the cloak to disengage?<br/><br/>7.

I hate to ask this but after a recent play session where this was debated now I'm all confused. I can't phrase this yes/no but I can try and make it multiple choice... <br/><br/>Quantum Torpedoes say: "If a target ship is hit, add 1 (hit) result to your total damage." <br/><br/>When does this apply? I.E. a "hit" means a hit result is rolled? y/n <br/><br/>This is a cancel-able hit correct?

But it got me thinking about when the torpedo's effect takes place... before or after other effects. <br/><br/>For example, if you rolled 3 blanks and 2 battle stations. Would the effect happen before you could spend a token to make those hits? Or would that step come first... then  because there is now a hit, you get the bonus? <br/><br/>I know I know... over thinking it... but in the crazy meta-game of our giant local play group, its good to know these things. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>As per the rulebook, page 14, a ship is considered "Hit" during the Compare Results stage.

Then flip this card face down.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>A few questions came up from that:<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k1.png" alt="1" border="0"> Do I have to have a target for an attack?  As it happens, I got this crit on a turn I was quite facing away from the enemy, and slowly looping around.  Can I just "attack" empty space on the following turn?  Fire a salvo into the void, then flip the card over?<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k2.png" alt="2" border="0"> This was during the OP2 event, and as it happens there WAS one of the OWPs directly in front of the ship in question on the first turn after the crit.  Now, the rules say these cannot be DESTROYED in OP2...<br/><br/>"For purposes of this tournament, disregard the Hull and Shield values as well as the SP Cost. The OWPs are not controlled by either player and may not be destroyed."<br/><br/>...however, they are definitely counted as an 'enemy ship'.  Could I *attack* that OWP?  Even if nothing will come of that - the rules say I cannot DESTROY it, it is a ship though, and the rules don't say I cannot ATTACK it, so...could I just 'attempt to fire away' at the OWP (without possible effect on it) to clear the crit?<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k3.png" alt="3" border="0"> Tournament judge ruled that, lacking an official answer, I could do neither of the above, so I was cruising along with my stunned helmsmen for a few turns (no enemy ships obliged me by crossing my path), and I ended up taking another crit from an OWP...<i>another</i> 'stunned helmsmen' (yes, the deck had been shuffled).  So...now I have two 'stunned helmsmen' crits.  The text on the card would appear to read that the next time I perform an attack, I roll no dice, and then flip the card down...but does that 'perform an attack' actually TRIGGER both cards?  Based on previous precedent for actions/events that trigger a card only triggering one relevant card at a time, the ruling was an aborted fire attempt would not clear both cards, but only one of them.  Ergo, I'd have to twice manage to get a ship in my sights - and shoot at it - before this effect would go away and I'd actually get to roll dice.  Is this a correct reading of the crit result?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>1. You must have a target.<br/><br/>2. Yes, you could fire at the OWP to clear the crit.<br/><br/>3. Each time you fire would only clear 1 of the Stunned Helmsman crits.</div>

EX:<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k1.png" alt="1" border="0"> If my ship is at 'battle stations'...do the ground combat results that come up with that result get converted to 'hits'?<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k2.png" alt="2" border="0"> In context of the event rule "The attacker rolls 1 attack die for each of his Ground Troop Tokens on AR-558 (max 4)" ...what happens if my ship triggering the attack has Donatra ("All other friendly ships within Range 1 of your ship gains +1 attack die.") nearby?  If I start with a 'max 4' attack from 4 ground groups...can she bump it up to 5 with her '+1 to attack'?  Or if the '4 dice attack' really is an ABSOLUTE max, but I had just 3 ground groups...would Donatra being near the triggering ship bump it up to the 4 value?<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k3.png" alt="3" border="0"> Can the 'command token' capability to add a dice to any attack be used, here?  (As with #2: ...to push an attack over 4 dice?  ...to push an attack UP TO 4 dice?)<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k4.png" alt="4" border="0"> Can the 'command token' capability to set a dice to a particular value, before rolling remaining dice, be used in ground combat?  What about the 'command token' "reroll" values?<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k5.png" alt="5" border="0"> If under the special effect of a weapon or crit, for example the Ferengi EM pulse ("Disable this card to target a ship at Range 1-2. The targeted ship rolls 1 less attack die and 1 less defense die this round") or the crit 'stunned helmsmen' ("The next time you attack, do not roll any attack dice. Then flip this card face down.")...does the triggering ship for a particular instance of ground combat have to deal with that penalty IN the ground combat?  (IE., I have four troops on the ground, I'd normally roll four dice, but my ship triggering the attack is under the effect of a Ferengi EM pulse, so...do I "roll one less attack die" to just roll three?)<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k6.png" alt="6" border="0"> If my ship has a captain or crew member that allow re-rolls or modifications of 'blank' results when attacking, does that re-roll benefit apply when the ship is triggering ground combat rolls?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>As a general rule, most of these situations would not assist the ground troops because they all specifically help ships, and ground troops are not ships. Even stuff that just increases your attack dice (like Scotty) is specifically tied in to the ship that it's located on (as per the card abilities section on page 21 of the full rules).<br/><br/>The exceptions I am aware of at the moment include: <br/><br/>1. Elite Attack Die (generic bonus to attack, not connected to a particular ship)<br/><br/>2. Command Tokens that specifically manipulate attack dice (also not connected to a particular ship). However, even these cannot allow you to exceed the maximum of 4 dice allowed by the scenario.<br/><br/>Also, if a ship loses the ability to attack, it cannot trigger an attack on the planet because that can only happen if the ship forgoes its normal attack.<br/><br/>Andrew<br/></div>

Okay, my co-designer (who created the Reinforcements Sideboard) got married over the weekend, so he wasn't available for questioning until today. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/tongue.gif" alt="" border="0"><br/><br/>He confirmed that you do NOT have to pay a Faction Penalty for placing a card on the Reinforcements Sideboard, but that you DO have to pay any "+5" penalties related to placing an Upgrade on a ship other than the one specified on the card.<br/><br/>More importantly, he mentioned that you are only allowed to access the Reinforcements Sideboard <b>once per turn</b>.

Geordi's card says "If your ship has a [SCAN] Token beside it, you may force one ship you attacked this round to re-roll one defense die of your choice." <br/><br/>So, if I understand the rules correctly, you could 'save' his ability for another ship to take advantage of later in the round, correct?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Correct.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Hi Andrew,<br/><br/>I am confused by this. The very first FAQ answer reads:<br/><br/><b>1. If I have a Ship, Captain, Upgrade, or Damage Card that uses the word "you", does it refer to that specific ship or to all of your ships?<br/>As mentioned on page 21 of the Full Rules (under "Card Abilities"), abilities on Ship Cards, Captain Cards, Upgrade Cards, and Damage Cards only affect the ship to which they are assigned, unless otherwise specified.</b><br/><br/>Based on the above, the phrase "<b>one ship you attacked</b>" in Data's text would refer to the attack by the ship he is on, and not carry over to an attack by another ship. Am I missing something?<br/><br/>Thanks!</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>This is perfectly consistent with the use of "you" and "your". What the card is saying is that when Geordi's ship attacks another, that defending ship is now "marked" to reroll a defensive die sometime this round, at the attacker's discretion. So if another ship on Geordi's team attacks THAT SAME TARGET, you can reroll a defensive die. <br/><br/>It's a perfect reading of that card, which I admit I had not considered.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>This is actually just a case of unclear wording on our part. Geordi's text works on a ship that his ship is attacking. So it works right away. The word "attacked" should just say "attack."<br/><br/>Sorry for the confusion,<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

The cards don't provide an answer, and there is no order in place for the planning phase.<br/><br/>This came up in a game recently in which an opponent played two cloaked mines, and then I played cloaked mines. He wanted to pick his up and replace them, but we just went ahead with the game since neither or us was sure about whether or not there's an order to be followed.<br/><br/>Naturally, where I placed my mines was in part due to where he had previously placed his mines, because it's a clue as to what his strategy might be.

Similar to Resources, you would score the SP of the Admiral's Orders if you eliminated the opponent's fleet. <br/><br/>For United Force, the extra 10 points worth of Upgrades should be marked on the Fleet sheet with an asterisk and not counted against the opponent's Fleet at the end of the match. This is similar to the cards that negin on the Reinforcements Sideboard.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

What if I came into battle, flying a Romulan Valdore-class with generic captain (28 pts) and a 'Klingon Advanced Weapons System' (6 points cost to me)...then that ship survived the battle, but at the end of the battle I'd swapped this out (via reinforcements) for a 2-point 'Polarized Hull Plating'.<br/><br/>Given a literal reading of the tournament rule, the enemy would be scoring that ship as removing only 28 points from their total.  The 6-point 'Advanced Weapons System' is not "still equipped on" the ship, so can't be scored.  And the 2-point 'Polarized Hull Plating' that IS equipped on the ship is ALSO not counted with it, as it is counted in the 10 points of reinforcements I have (since he didn't destroy all my ships).<br/><br/>That's...weird.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I've included this in my clarification. Essentially, this is one of the downsides of the Reinforcements Sideboard. Your opponent is not penalized for cards that started on your Sideboard or which started in play and ended up on your Sideboard at the end of the match.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>1 - Actually it seems more like an upside of the Sideboard.  In effect, a player could toss scorable points off a ship that has just maneuvered into a bad position.  It might make more sense to say that the original cost of the ship is subtracted - so, transferring off that 6 point Advanced Klingon Weapon System would not change the value of the Valdore from 34 to 28.<br/><br/>Thanks</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I'm not sure I understand. Your Fleet Score is equal to the maximum score (usually 100) minus what your opponent had left. So if you pull an Upgrade off a ship, then that Upgrade is still effectively out of play and won't subtract from your opponent's score. Also, remember that the Sideboard doesn't allow you to simply banish a card from a ship at will. You must exchange the card for one that is on the sideboard.<br/><br/>Now if you are able later to re-play an Upgrade from the Sideboard (that was originally in play on a ship) then that would be a nice advantage of the Sideboard and one that is in keeping with the spirit of this Resource (i.e. allowing Upgrades to retreat and return to battle).</div>

We've established in other posts that during the 6 steps of activation "after you move" is after step 3. (e.g. 'after you move' with Martok vs. Picard 'as a free action').<br/><br/>2. Therefore the Romulan pilot's 'after you move' ability happens after step 3 and before step 4 - Check for Power Strain.  <br/><br/>3. After step 3 but before step 4, no Auxiliary Power token yet exists from a Red Maneuver <i>this turn</i>.  If this is incorrect, please stop reading now and show me where is this FAQ'd or in the rules.<br/><br/>3. So therefore you <i>can</i> take a free action if you have no Auxiliary Power 'after you move'.  In the Pilot's case, this places a Scan token and immediately we re-execute steps 1-3.  <br/><br/>4. Once both moves are done, we then proceed to step 4, where the phrase "just executed" is murky for me.

Based upon this system, it is the case that the ship with the 180˚ arc is at a disadvantage. We inherited this wording from the previous system (which did not have 180˚ arcs), so that is why this anomalous situation is possible. I don't think it will come up too often, however! <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"><br/><br/>Andrew</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>But I thought its closest point to closest point...the diagram clearly shows the two closest points of each ship still pass through the planet?<br/><br/>Just my observation but if it works like that then the rules need to be amended.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>The rules are correct as written in this case. The "Attacking Through Obstacles" section and the "Planet Token" section both say "When measuring range during combat". If you read the section "Range" in the Combat section on page 13, it says very clearly: "To measure range, place the Range 1 end of the range ruler so that it touches the closest part of the attacker's base. Then point the ruler toward the closest part of the target ship's base that is inside the attacker's firing arc."<br/><br/>The rulebook could have made this issue clearer by mentioning the firing arc on pages 22 - 23, no question, but since it specifically refers to measuring range during combat, the rules as written are correct.</div>

You may divide your attack dice however you like, but you must roll at least 1 attack die against each ship.) and Antiproton Scan (If a Scan Token is beside your ship, add +1 attack die when firing against a ship has no Active Shields.) on a ship with a scan token and one ship being targeted has it’s shields disabled, where does the +1 attack die apply?

Disobey orders says "you may discard this card at any time to replace one scan, evasion or battlestations token beside your ship with one scan, evasion or battlestations token. since I can modify my attack dice in the order of my choosing, can I use dmitri with the scan token I have, then use Disobey Orders to switch it to battlestations in the modify dice step to spend it on my BS rolls?<br/><br/>4. Another Disobey Orders question, though this is just to confirm I understand the intention of the multiple triggers rule vs disobey Orders. Let's say I have Spock and Dmitri. After rolling attack dice, I choose to reroll two blanks with Dmitri. DO allows me to swap a scan token for a scan token - if the answer to #3 was yes, could I swap a scan token for a scan token so that Spock will technically trigger off of a separate token? I don't think this is the case, but I wish to be thorough if I'm already asking about disobey orders.<br/><br/>5. Jadzia Dax disables herself to let me perform a 2 maneuver, provided I do not attack. In terms of maneuver color/difficulty, does it go by my ship's dial or is it automatically treated as white? <br/><br/>6. For tournaments: Kirk's medals are purchased at 3 points each and set down next to him, meant to be secret from your opponent. But in tournaments, I have come to understand the opponents initial on your sheet each round to confirm he's checked your list for legality purposes. So how am I supposed to utilize Kirk's one advantage in a tournament when people can just look and see my upgrades? <br/><br/>7. Final question I swear! (had to add this in, this actually came up today) My friend and I play the Wrath of Khan Nebula battle scenario, in which shields are always down, and bumping makes both ships take damage unless you roll enough evades, and so on. He takes his Khan on Miranda with one hull point to bumps into my CC Enterprise with one hull point, and we both fail our rolls and die. My Kirk on Enterprise has Cheat Death and he has Stab at Thee. I cheat the death from the bump, then he blows me up with Stab at Thee since he died from the same bump. Does anyone win? I see the rule in the book about simultaneous destruction awarding victory to the player with initiative, and I'm not sure if there was anything I could do to live due to timing. It just seemed to be a really weird timing situation...<br/><br/><br/>Many thanks for your time!!</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>1. Yes.<br/><br/>2. Probably.<br/><br/>3. Yes, but it won't have the normal Scan effect (-1 to opponent's defense dice).<br/><br/>4. No<br/><br/>5. Ship's Dial<br/><br/>6. TD usually can verify the identity of the cards privately so it is not revealed on your sheet.<br/><br/>7. If you hadn't used Cheat Death, then initiative would have determined the winner. But since he destroyed you with I Stab at Thee!, he wins due to the exception listed on page 17.</div>

So the answer is no for the Enterprise, </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I'm not sure Picard should be any different. If the Picard action you want to do is also represented on the Enterprise's action bar, then it is "an Action listed on its Action Bar." The action could meet both requirements at the same time. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>But it's not the <i>ship</i> doing the Action, it's <i>Picard</i>. That's the difference. Picard has his own list of possible Actions, it just happens to mirror the Action Bar of the Ship. So the Enterprise could perform any of the Actions listed on it's Action Bar while it has an Aux token, but it can't perform any other Actions, like those Picard has available. Those are NOT on the Enterprise's Action Bar, they're on Jean-Luc Picard.<br/><br/>Also, Andrew gave my previous comment on this a "thumbs up", so this is the correct answer. He isn't making a separate comment if other people have already responded. He just thumbs up the answer. Much, much faster.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>For the sake of discussion I'd like to continue. Picard does not perform actions; Picard says "Each round, you may perform one of the following actions as a free action..." The word "You" is defined to refer to ships, so Picard on the Enterprise allows the Enterprise to perform an action, and the Enterprise can perform actions listed on its action bar while under Auxiliary Power. There is nothing that distinguishes Picard from other upgrades that grant a ship actions, so there is no reason to errata in a special exception for Picard and similar captains. The rules as written already handle this situation without ambiguity.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Just to clarify this ruling:<br/><br/>The Enterprise lets you perform an Action from its Action Bar even if you have an Auxiliary Power Token. Since the Flagship effectively adds an Action to the ship's Action Bar, it allows the Enterprise to perform the added Action even while under Auxiliary Power.<br/><br/>It is true that it is the ship that performs the Action, but in this case it is a question of the source of that Action. The intention of the Enterprise's ability is that it allows you to perform one of its native Ship Actions under dire circumstances. Therefore, when an Action is derived from its Action Bar (including one added to its Action Bar by the Flagship), then it can be performed while under Auxiliary Power. Picard does not add his Action to the ship's Action Bar, and that is why the ship cannot perform one of Picard's bonus Actions while under Auxiliary Power. This is how the Enterprise and Picard have interacted since the game released.<br/><br/>I understand Paul's argument, as he is focusing on the words "listed on" and taken literally, his argument has merit. However, (and please forgive this somewhat Clintonian explanation), it's all in how you define "listed" in this case. In this case, the intention of the word "listed" is that the Action is coming from the Ship's Action Bar and not another source. I understand the other interpretation as well, but this is why we have FAQ's, so that ambiguous text can be given a final clarification.</div>

Subtracting two dice from the support ship has no practical effect since the support ship isn't actually rolling dice during this attack.

Can you please help clarify something that has been coming up a lot for us? I've looked through the posts, but I haven't seen this particular clarification. Sorry if you've already answered this.<br/><br/>----------------------------<br/>From the first page FAQ - Weapon rule 12. If a ship starts its move within Range 1 of an enemy's Cloaked Mine, does it take damage when it moves this turn?<br/><br/>This works the same as the normal rules for a Minefield Token (see p. 23), just with a wider range. If the ship moves beyond the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it does not receive damage again this turn. But if it stays within the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it is does receive damage again this turn.<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Page 23 of the book states "when a ship executes a maneuver in which either the <b>maneuver template</b> or the ship's base physically overlaps a minefield token, this triggers the text of whichever card placed the minefield token in the play area."<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Scenario question: The cloaked mines are placed and a ship enters their influence and takes the hit. The ship does not manage to leave the range 1 influence of the cloaked mines. Next turn, when this ship moves, it's maneuver template will still have originated in range 1 of the cloaked mines, but the ship manages to move outside of the mines influence. Do they still take a hit from the cloaked mines as they leave it's influence?<br/><br/>According to page 23 of the book, the ship would take a second hit. But FAQ12 seems to state that they won't. Can you please clarify which one is correct?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Adam, the reference to the Maneuver Template is referring to when the ship first comes into contact with the Minefield. For example, if a ship flies <b>through</b> the Minefield (only touching it with the Maneuver Template), then it still takes damage.<br/><br/>To answer why it doesn't take damage when leaving the Minefield, refer to the following paragraph on page 23 (extrapolating the reference to the Minefield Token to include the entire Cloaked Minefield):<br/><br/>"IMPORTANT: When overlapping a Minefield Token, the ship stays where it lands (on top of the token). When the ship moves on its next turn, it may separate from the Minefield Token without penalty."</div>

Thematically, it certainly makes sense to award victory to someone who destroys the final enemy ship through a Suicide Attack.<br/><br/>When you look at the text on page 17 in the rulebook, this also seems to support it. After all, Suicide Attack does have text that triggers when the suicide ship is destroyed, namely that the other ship receives an 8 dice attack. If that 8 dice attack destroys "all enemy ships," then the suicide ship would win the match.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Thanks, Drew. The plan is to have a revised set of Admiral's Orders every month, so things will definitely be at least a little different in February. It is possible that some of the existing Admiral's Orders will remain, but they may be adjusted based on player feedback.<br/><br/>The thing to remember with Admiral's Orders is that player feedback is key. We need to know how they are affecting the environment, if something seems imbalanced, etc.<br/><br/>We look forward to hearing how they fare throughout the month of January.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

FYI: Based on player feedback, Chris and I have discussed the interaction of the Rav Laerst and Synon, and we have concluded that the Rav Laerst's restriction "forbids" the Rav Laerst to use anything but a 1 Straight template when performing a Sensor Echo with its special ability, and according the rules on page 18, that would not allow the Rav Laerst to benefit from Synon.<br/><br/>We've updated the front page of the FAQ with this ruling.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Since the hub and pylons are treated as distinct "ships" for attacking purposes (as each one gets its own firing arc and attack), would you be able to fire with the hub/pylons that didn't participate in the Barrage, or would the Barrage's effect prevent the entire station from firing that round?<br/><br/>Thanks again!</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Yes, it would be considered a friendly ship. If you use DS9 to assist Barrage, DS9 cannot fire at all that round.<br/></div>

Is it by highest skilled captain or maybe by the the faction with the most ships?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>There is no such thing as a "fleet faction". You as a player can declare your "fleet" to be any "faction" you wish in regards to the OP tournament. Everything else that keys off of factions (like squad building penalties) is determined on a per-ship basis (separate from all other ships).</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>One of the venues I play at requires at least 51 points of your 100 point build to be your declared faction.  It seemed silly to be flying two Romulan and one Fed ship and declare Klingon as a faction just to win for that faction that month.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I just always declare Dominion as my faction because the weird alliances make more sense if some of the captains are actually Changeling Infiltrators.</i></div></div></font><br/>It's a common theme in Star Trek to make quick alliances for various reasons. In Star Trek Nemesis for instance, Donatra commanding a fleet consisting of two Valdore Class warbirds fought to save the Federation from genocide at Shinzon's (technically Romulan) hands.<br/><br/>Picking a faction for Organized Play started with Heroclix Batman: No Man's Land. Just like Dominion War, players would pick a side to fight for, no matter what they were actually playing (Spider-Man could be played on behalf of Two Face) and the top players from the winning group won an additional prize, a Penguin character that could also be used as a resource. Choosing a faction is meant as another incentive to keep players engaged in the OP and it's not intended to be literally the main faction a player must play. i.e. "I want [chosen faction] to win the Dominion War" and not "you must play the [chosen faction] for 6 months straight".</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I was posing this question because I feel you can't run 4 Klingon ships and then say your faction is federation, or at least you shouldn't. But lets say you have one federation and three klingon can you know say your a federation faction.<br/><br/>I also realized re-reading the rules occasionally is important. I realized I had been playing that player initiative was determined by faction, but its determined by ship's faction. This becomes important when fleet builds are equal in points and captain skill is tied because its the ships faction that then determines initiative.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>If you are interested in determining your Main Faction for thematic purposes, take a look at the rules I mentioned above on page 22 for adding obstacles to a standard game.<br/><br/>Essentially, your Main Faction for the purposes of those rules is the faction on your most expensive ship (including all associated cards). So in your example, if your most expensive ship was Federation and the 3 Klingons were support ships, you would be a Federation fleet. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/cool.gif" alt="cool"><br/><br/>Andrew</div>

This attack is only shown once, in the DS9 episode "The Changing Face of Evil", and when the Defiant is hit it loses all of it's power and is unable to raise shields or move. Since the defense dice represent the ship's ability to maneuver and avoid damage, how is the defender able to roll defense dice on the second attack after being hit by the EDT?<br/><br/>Energy Dissipator<br/>Attack: Disable this card to perform this attack. If the attack hits, the target ship suffers no damage, receives 1 Energy Dampening Token, and you may immediately attack the same ship again with another weapon.   <br/><br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Yes. Take the EDT's effects literally in this case. The EDT's power was scaled for the purposes of game balance.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>If I take it literally, then the defender doesn't roll defense dice on the second attack, since they would have 0 agility. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I think you and I have a different definition of the word "literally." Nowhere on the Energy Dissipator or EDT reference card does it say that the target ship has a 0 Agility.</div>

It's explaining that unlike OP6 which states you follow a three player set up model OP5 is a two player.

Placing the ships first will mix things up nicely from every other month where the terrain was placed first & then the ships are placed based on that setup.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I just asked Chris G. about this, and he said that, similar to the other OPs, you set up the terrain first, and then place ships.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

I believe the intent was to mean for each damage that you would take then a crew or Captain upgrade is discarded. The rule book uses the same wording to state a ship is hit when it takes a critical hit or a normal hit.
