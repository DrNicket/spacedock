This is the preliminary FAQ to help people who are participating in tournaments during the coming weeks. This will eventually be replaced with a more formal FAQ in PDF format, but for now I want to keep it fluid and easy to update. To help the FAQ not get lost in a sea of new threads, I will link up to it in the "More Information" section on the main ST: AW page here on BGG.<br/><br/><br/><b>UPDATE (1/3/14):</font></b> All updates are in red.<br/><br/>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/><b>SPECIAL REQUESTS:</font><br/><br/>• Please use the following customized Google Search Engine (created by Rob Tsuk) to search for your topic to see if it has already been answered:<br/><br/><pre>     <a href="https://www.google.com/cse/publicurl?cx=009948891488379246407:viaeouugkt0" target="_blank" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">ST:AW FAQ Search Engine</a></pre><br/><br/>• Try to word your questions so that they require "yes" or "no" responses when possible.<br/><br/>• When asking multiple questions, please try to number them and avoid asking more than one question per number.<br/><br/>• When asking questions about a particular card, please quote the card text right in your post.<br/><br/>• Please do not send rules questions (or spoiler requests) to me privately.

If I have a Ship, Captain, Upgrade, or Damage Card that uses the word "you", does it refer to that specific ship or to all of your ships?</b><br/><br/>As mentioned on page 21 of the Full Rules (under "Card Abilities"), abilities on Ship Cards, Captain Cards, Upgrade Cards, and Damage Cards only affect the ship to which they are assigned, unless otherwise specified.<br/><br/><b>2. When Squad Building, is there a penalty for including ships of different Factions in the same Fleet?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>3. When I perform the Cloak Action, do I disable <i>all</i> of my remaining Shield Tokens, or do I get to keep one Shield Token Active?</b><br/><br/>You must disable <b>all</b> of your remaining Shield Tokens.<br/><br/><b>4. If two ships' bases are touching each other, do those ships ignore considerations of firing arc when attacking each other?</b><br/><br/>No. The rule on page 18 is simply meant to convey that ships can attack each other as normal when their bases are touching. The ships must still obey the firing arc requirements in order to target each other during the Combat Phase.<br/><br/><b>5. If a ship overlaps another ship or obstacle, can it still perform free Actions?</b><br/><br/>No. A ship that loses the ability to perform Actions also loses the ability to perform free Actions.<br/><br/><b>6. Can I voluntarily disable my Shields at any time (i.e. without using card text)?</b><br/><br/>No. However, if you de-Cloak during the End Phase, you can choose to not raise your Shields afterwards.<br/><br/><b>7. Can I voluntarily de-Cloak at any time (i.e. outside of the End Phase)?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>8. Does the term "friendly" on a card ever refer to the ship on which the card is located?</b><br/><br/>No, the term "friendly" only refers to other ships in your fleet.<br/><br/><b>9. When a card ability allows a player to gain a certain number of attack or defense dice "this round" (for example, Scotty), how does this work?</b><br/><br/>For attack dice, this allows the player to add that many attack dice (in total) to his attack rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If a player is able to make multiple attacks during the same Combat Phase, the player may choose when to add the bonus attack dice. These dice can even be added to Secondary Weapon attacks.<br/><br/>For defense dice, this allows the player to add that many defense dice (in total) to his defense rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If the player is attacked multiple times during the same Combat Phase, the player can choose when to add the bonus defense dice.<br/><br/>Note that this type of text is different from a continuous bonus which does not use the phrase "this round" (for example, the text on Donatra or Terrell). A continuous bonus applies to all attack and defense rolls made by the affected ships during that round.<br/><br/><b>10. When a card ability forces a player to roll fewer attack or defense dice "this round" (for example, Kyle), how does that work?</b><br/><br/>The player <b>must</b> roll fewer attack or defense dice in total during that round's Combat Phase, starting with the very next time the player uses those dice during the Combat Phase.<br/><br/><b>11. If a ship moves onto or through an Obstacle, can it perform any Actions later during the round?</b><br/><br/>No, a ship moving onto or through an Obstacle skips its Perform Actions step and also cannot perform additional Actions that round, such as through the use of Martok.<br/><br/><b>12. If a ship moves onto or through an Obstacle, can it still perform card text that does not require an Action (for example, can Martok still grant a free Action to another ship)?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>13. When checking to see if a ship's attack is blocked by a planet or other obstruction, should you lay the Range Ruler flat or on its edge?</b><br/><br/>For the purposes of this rule, the line separating the two ships is considered infinitely thin, so lay the Range Ruler on its edge for greater accuracy.<br/><br/><b>14. If an ability takes place after a ship moves, when precisely does this ability trigger?</b><br/><br/>It triggers after Step 5 (Clean Up) of the ship's Activation Phase, before its Perform Action step.<br/><br/><b>15. If an attacking ship has somehow managed to acquire multiple Scan Tokens (e.g. Romulan Pilot, Captain Janeway), does the defender roll 1 less defense die for each Scan Token?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>16. If one of my own cards requires me to "discard" or "disable" the card in order to activate its special ability, can I choose when to use this card (e.g. Worf (Starter), Uhura, McCoy)?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>17. Is it possible for a ship to perform the Cloak Action and the Sensor Echo Action in the same round (e.g. through the use of Martok)?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>SHIP CARDS</b><br/><br/><b>1. When the Enterprise-D uses its special ability, is it considered to be using its Primary Weapon? If so, does that mean it gains +1 attack die at Range 1?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>2. If the Valdore performs two Green Maneuvers during the same Activation Phase, does it receive its attack bonus twice?</b><br/><br/>No. The Valdore's text only checks to see if you have performed at least one Green Maneuver.<br/><br/><b>3. If the Kraxon uses its ability to absorb damage, can it trigger the text on its Counter Attack Upgrade? If the Kraxon only absorbs part of the damage received by my other ship, can both the Kraxon and that other ship trigger the text on their separate Counter Attack Upgrades?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>4. If Antimatter Mines are dropped on top of the Defiant, is it still considered to be "defending," even though it does not roll any defense dice?</b><br/><br/>Yes. However, this is not the case when the Defiant moves into mines (Antimatter or Cloaked) on a later turn.<br/><br/><b>5. Can the Rav Laerst's special Sensor Echo text be augmented by Synon?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>CAPTAIN CARDS</b><br/><br/><b>1. If a Captain is disabled for any reason, what is the Skill Number of his ship?</b><br/><br/>A ship with a disabled Captain has a Skill Number of 1. (It is assumed that a minor crew member has taken over for him.)<br/><br/><b>2. If James T. Kirk is on a non-Federation ship, must he pay +1 for his face down Federation Elite Talent Upgrades?</b><br/><br/>Yes, his ability changes the printed cost to 3, but does not exclude his Elite Talent Upgrades from the Faction Penalty.<br/><br/><b>3. Does Clark Terrell's ability add +1 defense die to his own ship, or just his allies' ships?</b><br/><br/>Clark Terrell does not add +1 defense die to his own ship.<br/><br/><b>4. Can the effect of Riker's Action trigger multiple times during the same round?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>5. If Martok's ship uses an ability that provides an additional maneuver, is this considered an extra "move" for purposes of triggering Martok's card text? (Negh'Var version)</b><br/><br/>No. When a Captain or Upgrade refers to a "move," it is only referring to the ship's initial movement for the turn. It does not apply to any bonus maneuvers that the ship might perform during the turn.<br/><br/><b>6. Does Martok's ability allow him to add +1 attack to his own ship, or just his allies' ships? (OP KIT 2 version)</b><br/><br/>Martok's ability does not affect his own ship.<br/><br/><b>7. If a Captain is disabled by Chang (or a similar effect) and has his or her Captain Skill reduced to "1", does that Captain potentially lose his or her chance to become the next active ship during the Activation Phase?</b><br/><br/>No. That ship is now considered the ship with "the next lowest Captain Skill".<br/><br/><b>8. If a Captain is disabled by Chang (or a similar effect), can that Captain's ship spend an Action to remove the Disabled Token? If so, can the Captain immediately use his or her card text?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes. Note that this is particularly good for Picard (since he can now perform a free Action) but does nothing for Martok (Negh'Var version) since Martok's text can only be used after he moves (i.e. <i>before</i> he takes an Action).<br/><br/><b>9. Can Mirok be used to repair critical damage? If so, can he repair any face up Damage Card of his choice before repairing normal damage?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>10. Does Gul Dukat allow you to perform an Evade or Battle Stations Action on a ship that does not have these Actions in its Action Bar?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>11. Can Captain Sulu disable a Crew Upgrade that is already disabled?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>ELITE TALENT UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. If a Captain is disabled for any reason, can his ship still use Elite Talent Upgrades?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>2. Can the effect of Counter Attack trigger multiple times during the same round?</b><br/><br/>No. However, a player may choose to not trigger the effect if he wishes (e.g. to use the effect against a ship firing later in the round).<br/><br/><b>3. After playing Cheat Death, how many Damage Cards should my ship still have?</b><br/><br/>Your ship will have a number of Damage Cards equal to your Hull Value - 1. In other words, Cheat Death effectively puts you at 1 damage point away from destruction.<br/><br/><b>4. If I play Cheat Death after my ship is instantly destroyed (e.g. Warp Core Breach, Suicide Attack), what happens?</b><br/><br/>In this case you would <b><i>add</i></b> Damage Cards one at a time until the number of Damage Cards is equal to your Hull Value - 1. All face up Damage Cards would still be flipped face down as per the card's text.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>CREW UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. Can Data's ship perform an Evasive Maneuvers Action <i>before</i> using Data's Action (for example, by using Picard)?</b><br/><br/>No, Data's Action cannot be used during the same turn his ship uses the Evasive Maneuvers Action.<br/><br/><b>2. Does Sulu's bonus to Agility affect each of your defense rolls during that round?</b><br/><br/>Yes. Sulu adds to the ship's Agility score, which has more lasting effects than simply adding a set number of dice that round.<br/><br/><b>3. Can a ship with multiple Tactical Officers re-roll the attack dice several times (one for each Tactical Officer)?</b><br/><br/>No, because that would be a case of more than one Upgrade triggering off the same Target Lock token (see "Upgrade Card Abilities and Action Tokens," page 22).<br/><br/><b>4. When exactly does the Romulan Pilot's text trigger?</b><br/><br/>It triggers right after Step 5 (Clean Up) of the Activation Phase, before the ship's Perform Action step.<br/><br/><b>5. Is the Romulan Pilot's free Action considered a "Scan Action"? If not, can it be performed in addition to a Scan Action?</b><br/><br/>It is not considered a Scan Action and can be performed in addition to a regular Scan Action. This would allow a ship to have 2 Scan Tokens, each independently affecting enemy ships attacked that round.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>WEAPON UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. If I spend my Target Lock to fire a Secondary Weapon (such as a Photon Torpedo), can I also use my Target Lock to re-roll attack dice?</b><br/><br/>No. Keep in mind that the Gor Portas' text presents an exception to his rule.<br/><br/><b>2. If my ship does not possess a rear firing arc, can I still fire a Torpedo from the rear of my ship if the Torpedo specifies it can be fired from the forward or rear firing arcs?</b><br/><br/>No. As per page 20 of the full rules of play, you must actually possess a rear firing arc to fire a Torpedo from the aft section of your ship.<br/><br/><b>3. If a Ship, Captain or Upgrade provides a bonus to my attack, does this apply to my Secondary Weapons as well?</b><br/><br/>Yes, unless specified otherwise.<br/><br/><b>4. Can I choose to fire the Forward Weapons Grid at only 1 enemy ship?</b><br/><br/>No, you cannot fire the Forward Weapons Grid unless there are at least two different enemy ships in your forward firing arc.<br/><br/><b>5. If my ship has an Energy Dampening Token (due to the Breen's Energy Dissipator), is my ship still considered to be performing a Straight White 1 Maneuver on the following turn? Would this allow me to perform an Action such as the one on the Cochraine Deceleration Maneuver afterwards?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes.<br/><br/><b>6. Does the Minefield Token follow the normal rules for Obstacles?</b><br/><br/>No. The Minefield Token is keyed to the text on the related Weapon Upgrade and does not add an additional die of damage or cause the loss of an Action like a normal Obstacle does. However, as per the rulebook on p. 23, the Minefield <i>does</i> obstruct fire like a normal Obstacle.<br/><br/><b>7. Must the Antimatter Mines be placed entirely within the Range 1 portion of my rear firing arc?</b><br/><br/>No, the Antimatter Mines can be placed anywhere that is at least partially in the Range 1 portion of your rear firing arc.<br/><br/><b>8. After firing the Antimatter Mines, does the Minefield Token remain in the play area for the duration of the game?</b> <br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>9. Can the attack dice rolled for Antimatter Mines be modified in any way?</b><br/><br/>Yes, but only when you drop the Minefield Token directly on top of another ship. In this case, the <b>number</b> of attack dice can be altered by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra. Special Upgrade powers that modify dice (such as Spock and Drex) are also effective in this case, and you may also substitute the Elite Attack Die for one of the normal attack dice. However, since the Antimatter Mines are a special form of attack that do not follow the normal rules of the Combat Phase, you cannot use Target Lock or Battle Stations tokens to modify the attack dice (and your opponent cannot use Evade tokens to cancel hits).<br/><br/>If a ship later moves onto or through an already placed Minefield Token, the dice cannot be altered at all, even by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra.<br/><br/><b>10. Must I place my Cloaked Mines at the start of the Planning Phase, or can I wait until after everyone has set their Maneuver Dials?</b><br/><br/>You place your Cloaked Mines at the start of the Planning Phase. This does not mean that other players can negate your ability to use the Cloaked Mines by quickly placing their Maneuver Dials. It simply means that after you place your Cloaked Mines, your opponents are free to alter their Maneuver Dials.<br/><br/><b>11. If the trigger areas for two Cloaked Mines overlap, does an enemy ship passing through the overlapping trigger area sustain damage from both Cloaked Mines?</b><br/><br/>No. In this case the ship would only be damaged by one of the Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/>However, if a ship passes through (and completely out of) the trigger area of one Cloaked Mine and into the trigger area of another Cloaked Mine, then the ship sustains damage from both Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/><b>12. If a ship starts its move within Range 1 of an enemy's Cloaked Mine, does it take damage when it moves this turn?</b><br/><br/>This works the same as the normal rules for a Minefield Token (see p. 23), just with a wider range. If the ship moves beyond the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it does <b><i>not</i></b> receive damage again this turn. But if it stays within the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it is <b><i>does</i></b> receive damage again this turn.<br/><br/><b>13. If a ship attacks normally during the Combat Phase, can it later be used to assist during a Barrage of Fire?</b><br/><br/>No. A ship cannot attack normally and participate in the Barrage of Fire during the same turn.<br/><br/><b>14. If a ship's attack is increased in some way, does this also boost its "Primary Weapon Value" for purposes of the Barrage of Fire?</b><br/><br/>No. Use the ship's printed "Primary Weapon Value." This can only be increased if the ship becomes your Flagship (OP Month 4).<br/><br/><b>15. If a Cloaked ship assists during a Barrage of Fire, must it flip its Cloak Token over to the red side?</b><br/><br/>Yes. The ship is still considered to have "fired" this turn.<br/><br/><b>16. If a ship assists during a Barrage of Fire, can it later assist another Barrage of Fire during the same Combat Phase?</b><br/><br/>No. Since Barrage of Fire is a Weapon Upgrade, the assisting ship is considered to have already participated in a Secondary Weapon attack, which is a normal attack.<br/><br/><b>17. Do Concussive Charges deal damage in addition to removing tokens?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>TECH UPGRADES</b><br/><br/><b>1. How long does the effect of the Tractor Beam last?</b><br/><br/>The Tractor Beam only lasts until the end of the current Round.<br/><br/><b>2. If the Interphase Generator reduces an attacker's damage to exactly 1 Hit, can the defender cancel that Hit as normal?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>3. Is Suicide Attack considered an "attack" for card text purposes?</b><br/><br/>Yes. Keep in mind that Scan, Target Lock, Evade, and Battle Stations tokens cannot be used during a Suicide Attack because it does not follow the normal Combat sequence. Moreover, a Cloaked ship does not roll +4 defense dice against a Suicide Attack because this bonus only applies during the Combat Phase.<br/><br/><b>4. Must I use the Positron Beam at the start of the Planning Phase, or can I wait until after everyone has set their Maneuver Dials?</b><br/><br/>You must use the Positron Beam at the start of the Planning Phase. This does not mean that other players can negate your ability to use the Positron Beam by quickly placing their Maneuver Dials. It simply means that after you use your Positron Beam, your opponents are free to alter their Maneuver Dials.<br/><br/><b>5. What is the exact sequence for using the Navigational Deflector against a Minefield?</b></font><br/><br/>The ship enters a minefield (or gets Antimatter Mines dropped on top of it). The minefield owner rolls attack dice. The ship can disable its Navigational Deflector to cancel 1 hit and roll defense dice against the remainder (no +4 bonus dice for Cloak unless it is the Combat Phase). Afterwards, the Navigational Deflector goes offline until the Disabled Token is removed.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>RESOURCES</b><br/><br/><b>1. How many different Resources can I include when building my fleet?</b><br/><br/>Each player can include a maxiumum of 1 Resource when building his or her fleet.<br/><br/><b>2. How are Resources scored during tournaments?</b><br/><br/>If the winner of an Engagement completely eliminates his opponent's fleet, then he receives Fleet Points for his opponent's Resource. If the winner does not eliminate the opponent's entire fleet, he does not receive Fleet Points for his opponent's Resource.<br/><br/><b>3. Can I use more than one Command Token during the same round?</b><br/><br/>No, you may use only one Command Token during each game round.<br/><br/><b>4. When am I allowed to activate each of the different Command Tokens?</b><br/><br/>The Command Tokens are used as appropriate for the ability provided by the token.<br/><br/>• Tokens that provide a free Action are used during the ship's Perform Action step during the Activation Phase.<br/><br/>• Tokens that let you re-roll dice are used during the appropriate Modify Dice step of the Combat Phase.<br/><br/>• Tokens that are used "before rolling any of your [attack or defense] dice" are used right before rolling those dice.<br/><br/><b>5. Must I include one of each card type in order to make use of the Reinforcements Sideboard?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>6. Must I pay a Faction penalty when placing cards on the Reinforcements Sideboard?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>7. If an Upgrade has an additional cost if purchased for a ship other than the one listed on the card (e.g. Varel, Energy Dissipator), must I pay this penalty when adding the card to the Reinforcements Sideboard?</b><br/><br/>Yes, because the Upgrade is being added to the Sideboard instead of the indicated ship.<br/><br/><b>8. May I use the Reinforcements Sideboard more than once per game round?</b><br/><br/>No, you may only access the cards on the Reinforcements Sideboard once during each game round.<br/><br/><b>9. How are the cards on the Reinforcements Sideboard scored at the end of a tournament round?</b><br/><br/>The cards that start the game on the Reinforcements Sideboard are inextricably linked to the Sideboard for scoring purposes. Therefore, if a match ends in a tie, then any Sideboard cards currently on ships (or tucked under Ship Cards) do not count for scoring purposes. Any cards that started the match in play but which are now on the Reinforcements Sideboard are considered out of play as well, so they also do not count for scoring purposes.<br/><br/>If a player eliminates all of his opponent's ships, then he scores 10 points for that opponent's Reinforcements Sideboard. If a player does not eliminate his opponent's ships, then he does not score those points.<br/><br/><b>10. If Khan (Reliant version) is the Captain of a ship when a cross-faction card is placed from the Sideboard onto his ship, is an Auxiliary Power Token still placed beside the ship?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>11. When designating a non-Independent ship as an Independent Flagship, does the ship now possess both Factions? If so, does this remove Faction penalties for Independent cards placed on that ship?</b><br/><br/>Yes and yes. For initiative purposes, use the ship's original printed Faction. Using an Independent Flagship also allows the use of Independent cards on a non-Independent Ship when using the United Force Admiral's Order. <br/><br/><b>12. Does the Primary Weapon bonus on a Flagship card increase the damage of the Enterprise-D's special ability?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>SPACE STATIONS & STATIONARY PLATFORMS</b><br/><br/><b>1. Are Space Stations (e.g. DS9, Scenario Space Stations) and Stationary Platforms (OWPs, PDTs) considered "ships" for card text purposes?</b><br/><br/>Yes, but these "Stations" also follow several special rules as detailed below.<br/><br/><b>2. Can any special abilities allow a Station to move?</b><br/><br/>No. This also means that a Station cannot perform a Sensor Echo Action.<br/><br/><b>3. Can a Station ever have its Agility increased (e.g. Hikaru Sulu, Tom Paris)?</b><br/><br/>No, although Stations can benefit from abilities that increase overall defense dice (Cloaking, Tetryon Emissions, etc.)<br/><br/><b>4. Can a Station be damaged by Antimatter Mines?</b><br/><br/>Yes, but only during the turn that the Mines are dropped directly on the Station. A Station does <b><i>not</i></b> receive damage from Mines on subsequent turns.<br/><br/><b>5. Can a Station be designated as a Flagship using the Flagship Resource?</b><br/><br/>No.<br/><br/><b>6. Is it possible for a Station to remove an Auxiliary Power Token or an Energy Dampening Token?</b><br/><br/>Yes. During a Station's turn to act during the Activation Phase, it removes 1 Auxiliary Power Token or 1 Energy Dampening Token automatically at the end of Step 5 (Clean Up).<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>OP TOURNAMENT - MONTH 1</b><br/><br/><b>1. The Tournament Guidelines are contradictory regarding the number of points given to a player who receives a Bye. What is the correct amount?</b><br/><br/>A player receiving a Bye gains 2 points (not 3).<br/><br/><b>2. Can members of the Away Team use their abilities while on DS9?</b><br/><br/>No. The only information retained by the Away Team is the Captain's Skill Number.<br/><br/><b>3. Can you clarify the text regarding battles between opposing Away Teams on Deep Space 9?</b><br/><br/>The text for this is being revised for greater clarity in later OP Kits:<br/><br/><i>The player with the highest Captain Skill on DS9 rolls 1 attack die for every card that is in his Away Team; the other player rolls 1 defense die for every card that is in his Away Team. For every uncancelled [Hit] result, the defending player discards 1 Captain or [Crew] Upgrade of his choice from his Away Team. After the player with the higher Captain Skill attacks, the player with the lower Captain Skill attacks with the remaining members of his Away Team in the same way.<br/><br/>If both players have the same highest Captain Skill, then the player with initiative attacks first; however, any defeated Captains or Crew may fire back before being discarded as per the Simultaneous Attack Rule.<br/><br/>Note: If a player has no Captain on DS9, his Away Team is considered to have a Captain Skill of 1.</i><br/><br/><b>4. Can I send multiple Captains to DS9?</b><br/><br/>Yes, all of your cards (even from different ships) are part of the same Away Team. Only use the Captain Skill of your best Captain.<br/><br/><b>5. If an Away Team's ship is destroyed, what happens to the Away Team?</b><br/><br/>For purposes of the OP scenario, the Away Team survives on DS9.<br/><br/><b>6. If DS9 is destroyed, what happens to any Away Teams that are aboard it?</b><br/><br/>They are destroyed (i.e. discarded from play).<br/><br/><b>7. Can DS9 fire out of both exposed Pylons, as well as the Main Body, during the same turn? If so, what is DS9's firing arc?</b><br/><br/>Yes, DS9 can attack with both exposed Pylons and the Main Body every turn. At Range 1-2, its firing arc is in all directions. At Range 3, use the individual Pylons to determine firing arc.<br/><br/><b>8. How does using the DS9 Token work in normal battles outside the tournament?</b><br/><br/>• DS9 is not a "normal" ship, and therefore it is only allowed if both players agree to its inclusion. It is certainly not allowed in tournament play unless the scenario specifically calls for it (i.e. you can't fill out your tournament squadron with a DS9 Token!).<br/><br/>• If both players agree to permit DS9 in their game, then the players can either agree on its placement (such as in the dead center of the play area) or perhaps have the owner place it within range 2 of his starting area.<br/><br/>• Alternatively, you can decide that no player controls DS9 and place it equidistant from each Starting Area; in this case, the station costs 0 Squadron Points. Use the rules for taking control of the station from the OP Kit instructions. The main thing here is to make sure both players agree and have a good time!<br/><br/>• Each Pylon, as well as the main body of DS9, can fire independently, giving it a potential 4 attacks per round. When firing from the main body of DS9, you start measuring range from the outside edge of the token.<br/><br/>• For purposes of initiative between DS9's two visible Factions, DS9 is considered to use the Faction with the higher initiative (in this case, Federation).<br/><br/>• DS9 does not move under any circumstances, even as the result of Captain or Upgrade abilities (e.g. Gul Ranor).<br/><br/>• DS9 and all space stations used in Missions are considered "ships" for purposes of card text. However, card text that causes a space station to move is ineffective.<br/><br/>• Secondary Weapons can only be fired from the Pylons on DS9 (not from the Main Body).<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>OP TOURNAMENT - MONTH 2</b><br/><br/><b>1. Do the OWPs receive +1 attack die at Range 1?</b><br/><br/>No, they are considered special weapons and do not receive this bonus.<br/><br/><b>2. Does the debris count as an intervening obstacle when defending against an OWP?</b><br/><br/>Yes, you would receive +1 defense die when defending against an OWP if debris is in the line of fire.<br/><br/><b>3. Are OWPs considered "ships" for card text purposes?</b><br/><br/>Yes. They are considered "enemy ships" and "opponents."<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>OP TOURNAMENT - MONTH 3</b><br/><br/><b>1. During Setup, are the extra Ground Troop and SAM Tokens assigned to a particular ship?</b><br/><br/>No. They are placed beside your Ship Cards but can enter play whenever any ship uses the related Action.<br/><br/><b>2. Are the Fleet Points for occupying AR-558 awarded to both the winner and loser of the engagement?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><b>3. Do the Fleet Points awarded for occupying AR-558 help determine the winner in the case of a tie?</b><br/><br/>Yes.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>OP TOURNAMENT - MONTH 4</b><br/><br/><b>1. Do the PDTs receive +1 attack die at Range 1?</b><br/><br/>No, they are considered special weapons and do not receive this bonus.<br/><br/><b>2.

If a ship has two factions tied to it, like DS9, which faction matters for initiative? I assume it's like having two ships with the same cost and different factions, by choosing randomly.</div>

Yes, this is my fault. When we realized during blind playtests that the term "friendly" came across as ambiguous, we added the word "other" to most of those cards (such as Gowron and Donatra), but somehow we missed poor Terrell.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Text referring to a white maneuver, I'm thinking of Chekov removing an aux after a white maneuver, does not also apply to green, correct?<br/><br/>Right now all of the movement actions either allow a green, like Engage, or give something like Gul Ranor's, which happens to be green for all current ships. If he were on some future ship that had a white forward 2 it might apply, allowing the Gul to move 2 and take an aux token that Chekov would immediately remove, but it doesn't seem like this is the case now, unless it extends since it's just about performing an "easy" movement.</div>

I guess I mostly just meant if that movement was the result of an action rather than a movement made during the dial and reveal phase, though it doesn't apply to the current set of ships. It being a green movement indicated by Ranor or whoever doesn't matter for the point of taking the aux token to begin with, but whether some combination of other card abilities could instantly cancel them or that always has to wait for the next turn.</div>

If a captain with a skill of 2 boards DS9, would you be able to use DS9 in that same turn at the same captain skill? If not why not? I assume you'd still be able to move and use an action on another one of your ships with a captain skill of 2 in the same turn.<br/><br/>What happens if you don't send a captain and it's beyond Captain Skill 1s turns to do actions?<br/><br/>EDIT: Sorry about all these questions, I figured you want as much fair questions as possible now, then get them later.

As the rules stand, you can buy a single expansion (as buy-in for the tournament) and combine it with two ships from the starter for a 100 point fleet. That's as small as the initial investment can be, realistically.<br/><br/>I would let the long run take care of itself. We're going to be seeing new ships every 1-2 months to shake things up during the Dominion War series of events; if things slow down later, or some degenerate fleet shows up despite the new ships, then the rules for future tournaments can change.<br/><br/><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>delta_angelfire wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>Also, how do we resolve initative ties then: on a ship-to-ship basis or by the highest initiative ship in a fleet and then apply to the whole fleet?

To add to what Bwian just said, from a practical point of view, it's much easier to even out the factions if the ships aren't required for faction participation...........it prevents things like the Federation having 10 players and the Romulans only having 1.<br/><br/>And from experiencing based events from WK in the past (No Man's Land and the current Fear Itself in heroclix) big imbalances in the factions makes that part of the event much less enjoyable from my PoV.</div>

Ah, so "after" is more like directly after, limited to a single step, and abilities can't chain off each other during the action phase.<br/><br/>As much as I like theme, the mixing of ships is good to get people involved in this. Too bad that the variability of those mixes and the need to prepare a squad make it so you can't give different point caps for the scenario so that they make more sense, deciding by a dice roll or something whether one person is going to be a defender. That would be a lot more fun than just fighting over a planet which randomly shoots at anyone or competing to see who can take out Starfleet HQ, but then that's the point of distributing the pieces. Once we get our play groups established we can do that on our own.</div>

What's the official stance on mods for larger OP events, like worlds or something?<br/><br/>Are custom paint jobs allowed? Like adding a wash for more detail.<br/><br/>What about a different model altogether? Like putting the clear model of a Romulan Warbird (Heart of Stars from Heroclix Set Tactics II) on a D'Deridex stand? Or a more detailed scaled version of the original Enterprise on an Enterprise stand?</div>

For official <i>-competitive-</i> events though it needs to be restrictive and well structured. Anything less will just leave the people who are going to pour the most money into this game out in the cold. There should be an official stance, and if the stance really is "use anything and everything", the casual scene may be happy but the competitive scene will be crap. There's nothing worse than having a company having conflicting design concepts about its own game. It doesn't inspire confidence and doesn't keep people coming back for more. <br/><br/>If you gear a game toward the casuals (which is fine) but don't account for the min/maxers, you're not going to have a lasting game community. Make the official tournaments structured and then let the local tournaments choose to be less restrictive, not the other way around.</div>

I don't want to stifle good debate about squad building and such, but that is a bit off topic for this thread. Can we stick to the FAQ please? Since I am running the OP event in my store I have subscribed to this thread, so not really interested in seeing lots of updates with posts about off-topic stuff. <br/><br/>Those topics deserve discussion, but please make another thread for it. Thanks.</div>

What's the ruling on using abilities of crewmembers on DS9 to repair shields? Romulan Captain Mirok or Klingon crewmember Konmel come to mind for examples.<br/><br/>Is it possible for them to use their actions while aboard DS9? Do I have to have control of the station to do so? If I can repair the shields, does that prevent more crew beaming in until those shields are somehow disabled? Could a different crewmember aboard DS9 subsequently use an ability to disable the shields of the station?<br/><br/>Don't mean to overwhelm you with questions.

The action to put crew on DS9 doesn't say anything about DS9's shield needing to be down, it's probably an oversight, but it's rather small to make a change about it. They might just rule that DS9 can't get shields repaired in this scenario.</div>

However, any text that causes a space station to "move" is ineffective.<br/><br/>Keep in mind as well that for the purposes of the OP scenario, there is a disclaimer written in the OP rules that says that Away Teams cannot be targeted by any effects other than those specified by the scenario.<br/><br/>That wouldn't stop you from unloading some Tribbles, of course... <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/wow.gif" alt="wow"></div>

I had an Auxiliary Power Token, and was unfortunately hit with the Breen Energy Dissipator.  Now I move 1 white, have shields disabled, and can't attack.

Therefore, although the Auxiliary Power Token prevents you from taking an Action on your next turn, you can still fire during the next turn's Combat Phase and then raise shields during that Endphase. On the third turn, you can move as normal, removing the Auxiliary Power Token if you perform a Green Maneuver.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

I spoke to Chris G. about this, and he explained that the DS9 Token will work in the same way as the DS9 model, and in both cases a ship overlapping DS9 is considered to be <i>under</i> the model (or possibly "over" the space station in 3D conceptual space).<br/><br/>Therefore, DS9 can fire at a ship overlapping it, and this is considered a Range 1 attack. However, because DS9 is literally firing through itself (an obstacle), the defending ship receives +1 defense die. Conceptually, this represents the guns on DS9 avoiding firing at the station itself.<br/><br/>Similarly, a ship overlapping DS9 can fire at the station at Range 1, and DS9 would receive +1 defense die. Conceptually, this is because the ship is weaving around trying to avoid crashing into DS9.<br/><br/>And most importantly, there is no "pew pew" sound in space, although I realize the source material contradicts this. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/laugh.gif" alt="laugh"><br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Sir,  can you explain the ruling on Khan? He is only a skill other than his listed skill as an effect of his card text. That text is not applicable by virtue of the card being disabled as per being an away team member per scenario rules.  <br/><br/>The only justification I can see is if he gets the skill number during deployment and for the remainder of game.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/></div>

Thanks for the clarification Cap'n but are you sure Independent suffer the +1 out of faction penalty? As there are no Independent ships the only way to use them without the extra cost is with Khan's ability. </div>

You can reduce the cost of a Crew Upgrade to 0 with Pike, but you would still have to pay any appropriate Faction Penalty. There is currently no way to avoid the Faction Penalty on an Independent Crew Upgrade without Khan. Those followers of Khan are simply too unruly for most Captains to handle!<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

I have three questions:<br/><br/>First of all, regarding text that reads, "on a [HIT] result, do x", do [CRITICAL HIT] results count as well? I'm assuming not, but want to clarify.<br/><br/>Next, in the OP Month 1 description of the Self-Replicating Mines, do the "contact damage" rules replace the normal "roll for damage" rules for Obstructions, or are they in addition to the normal damage?<br/><br/>Finally, regarding cloaking timing: Let's say I have the IRW Khazara, cloaked, at the beginning of my turn. During combat, it attacks, so the cloak token flips to the red side. However, it's still considered cloaked, so it still has its +4 defense dice until the end of the round. During cleanup at the end of the round, the token disappears, and my shields reactivate. During the activation phase, I use my action to re-cloak. Now if I attack this turn, I'm considered cloaked for the purpose of using the Khazara's ability ("If you initiate an attack while cloaked, add +1 attack die"), correct? And I also have the +4 defense dice, right?<br/><br/>If I'm understanding it correctly, the only downside to losing your cloak after an attack is that you can be target locked (well, that and having to spend your action). You still get all the other benefits by re-cloaking each turn. Am I reading this right?<br/><br/>Thanks for any answers you have...</div>

Hi, Kenn.<br/><br/>1) Correct, if it shows a specific icon (Hit), it does not apply to another icon (Critical Hit).<br/><br/>2) Correct, the Self-Replicating Mines do different damage than normal Obstacles.<br/><br/>3) You are correct. The Khazara can keep cloaking every turn and getting that bonus. The downside to firing each turn is that, as you mentioned, you can be target locked and you must keep spending your Action every turn to re-cloak. Also, you won't have time to Sensor Echo, one of the most powerful benefits of cloaking.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

For abilities that repair shields: do the repaired shield tokens come back as Active or Disabled? If active, does that mean you could repair a shield and have it active while cloaked? <br/><br/>Obviously if they come back as inactive they would be useless until after the next end phase when they can be raised.</div>

the Ferengi EM Pulse:<br/><b>Action:</b> Disable this card to target a ship at Range 1-2 that is not in your forward firing arc.  Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside the target ship.  The target ship rolls 2 less attack dice this round.<br/><br/>So, let's say I put this on a ship with low pilot skill. I move first, use this action, and give a ship an Aux token. When it comes their turn to move, if they reveal a red maneuver, I get to choose any other non-red maneuver for them to do instead, right? This seems really nasty!</div>

Place 1 Mission Token on your Ship Card.<br/><br/><font color='#003399'><b>=======================================</b></font><br/><br/>and the special ability of the USS Enterprise  <br/><br/><font color='#FF0000'><b>=======================================</b></font><br/>The USS Enterprise can perform an Action listed on its Action Bar while it has an Auxiliary Power token.<br/><font color='#FF0000'><b>=======================================</b></font><br/><br/><br/><br/>Now because the action granted by the scenario <b><i>doesn't</i></b> use wording like <i>'for this scenario you may add this action to your ships action bar'</i>  and the Enterprise's ability is worded that the action taken must be on the Action Bar........ that you wouldn't be able to beam aboard survivors.<br/><br/>Is that correct?<br/><br/>I fear that it is...... but I'm trying to figure out all the tricks of the scenario for the arsenal. <br/><br/><br/>And if that is correct, why are you and Chris such meanies? <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/tongue.gif" alt="" border="0"> <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/tongue.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

The Enterprise's ability doesn't say "you may perform an action even if you have an auxiliary power token", as you pointed out; instead it specifies what type of action you may perform (i.e., "listed on your action bar"). That implies that you can't perform an action that's not on the action bar.<br/><br/>As to your last question, I'll repeat what I said in the Kobayashi Maru thread: You do know you're not <i>supposed</i> to be able to win, right? <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/wink.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

Kenn is correct. You cannot beam aboard survivors if you have an Auxiliary Power Token.<br/><br/>Yes, we are definitely mean. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/devil.gif" alt="devil"><br/><br/>That said, the scenario is meant to be extremely challenging. As I mentioned in the other thread, the best I've done is get all the survivors aboard and get within one turn of leaving on turn 8. But then I died. If the Klingon ship had rolled crap, I'd have won! <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/surprise.gif" alt="surprise"><br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Okay a dumb pedantic question for the first OP mission.<br/><br/>From reading the rules it looks like you don't need to beam a captain over to gain control of DS9. If so, do you still get to act (at skill 0)? Also do you still get to shoot back when in close combat on the station (last)?</div>

Donatra and Terrell grant the +1 die to every attack or defense because the text is open-ended (no time specification).<br/><br/>The difference with Scotty is that he defines that he is given +2 dice "this round," which means he gets a total of +2 attack dice to use as needed during the round.</div>

Just a question on the Warp Core Breach critical damage card.  Was there ever a thought to make an explosion from the end result with like a Range 1-2 blast or something?  As it is the whole Warp Core Breach thing seems a little tame compared to what it should be.  Granted possibly losing a ship over a single critical hit is powerful, but I was expecting to see some way for a Warp Core going critical to damage nearby ships.  Something for a possible future add on perhaps?</div>

Just a couple of questions:<br/><br/>1.<br/>The Ferengi Missile Launchers text states:<br/><br/>"Make 2 Attacks against ship(s) in your forward firing arc. Roll 2 Attack Dice for each o these Attacks."<br/><br/>Does this mean that things which boost attack dice can't affect the number of Dice rolled or can the rolls still be affected by cards like Donatra, etc.<br/><br/>2. <br/>The Defiant and Polarised Hull cards both allow crits to be changed into hits (though only one in the case of the polarised hull).<br/><br/>However Torath's card changes a hit to a critical.<br/><br/>In this instance which effect would take precedence, would:<br/><br/>a) Torath rolls her attack dice and then uses her ability<br/> to change a hit into a critical. Then the Defiant rolls defence dice and if any criticals are not evaded they use the ship ability to turn them into hits.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>b) Both attack and defence dice are rolled and abilities are then applied in initiative order from lowest captain to highest.<br/><br/>The first will always result in no critical hits on the Defiant while the second would depend on the relative captain skills and would result in 1 critical hit provided the original roll had a critical and the Defiant's pilot had a lower initiative.<br/><br/>Personally I think a) would be correct but can you clarify this.<br/><br/>Thanks.</div>

Sorry, thought of another one while trying to build my Dominion war fleet.<br/><br/>If you are lucky enough to drop the anti-matter mines so that they touch 2 ships would you:<br/><br/>a) have to split the attack dice (if so would this need to be an even split)<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>b)roll 4 dice and apply the same result to both ships<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>c) roll 4 dice for each ship individually<br/><br/></div>

1. Yes, you can boost the number of attack dice used with Ferengi Missile Launchers.<br/><br/>2. As per the rulebook, page 13: "If the attacker and defender both have abilities that modify attack dice, the defender resolves all of his abilities before the attacker resolves any."<br/><br/>Therefore, Toreth would always be able to land a crit against the Defiant or a ship with Polarized Hull Plating.<br/><br/>3. Each ship that is hit by the Antimatter Mines is affected separately, so the answer is "c".</div>

Do Muon tokens stack for additional damage? And do you remove 1 or all Muon tokens when you take an action to remove them?<br/><br/>Muon Reference: A Muon Token stays with a ship until it is removed.During the Activation Phase after the ship moves, the ship takes damage to its Hull equal to the number of its current Maneuver -1. The type of maneuver does not matter, just the number.After the ship performs a Green or White Maneuver, it can spend an Action to remove the Muon Token.<br/></div>

Spock: Yes.<br/><br/>Drex: Sort of. You can only convert 1 Battle Stations to a Crit for the whole round. But your other Battle Stations can be converted to Hits as normal.</div>

Hi Andrew-<br/>Question about Deep Space 9 token.<br/><br/>1.  Within the OP month 1 event, if a player is controlling DS9, how many attacks does DS9 get?  Is it still 2 pylon attacks & 1 main body attack each turn?<br/><br/>2.  Outside of the OP event, using the DS9 token in home-brew scenarios, how many attacks is DS9 intended to get per turn?  Up to 3 pylons & 1 main body?<br/><br/></div>

If I was staring down 6 science vessels each with Muon tokens, when it looks like they're close to in range I'd be doing 1 maneuvers only (damage is maneuver number minus 1 to the hull) and be VERY spread out.  The Muon token can only be attached to a ship once.<br/><br/>But I'm sure this will catch someone off guard right before a 4 maneuver...</div>

I sent this to Andrew via a PM, and he suggested I post it publicly. I'm also looking for other input from players, so this works out for me.<br/>[q=Kengi]According to the rules for the first months' event, the Krayton ships are to be "...awarded to the First (Admiral) and Red Shirt (Fellowship) players."<br/>I know the First (Admiral) player is the person who does the best overall. Who is the Red Shirt (Fellowship) player? I see nothing else noted for either of those terms in the rules."</i></div></div></font><br/>And Andrew said:<br/>[q=Andrew Parks]It is up to the discretion of the TO. Often it is seen as a sportsmanship award, or perhaps a reward for the most thematic or creative build, etc.</i></div></div></font><br/>So here are the ideas I've come up with so far. What I'm considering, to make it less possible to game, is to randomly determine at the end of each event which method we'll have count.<br/><br/>1) Second place<br/>2) Last place<br/>3) Best thematic build (Popular hidden vote)<br/>4) Best sportsmanship (Popular hidden vote)<br/>5) Random player<br/><br/>I'm open to arguments against these, as well as other ideas.<br/><br/>Thank you, Andrew, for your quick response.</div>

I used to run Mechwarrior events for WK. We always used sportsmanship for the prize. In fact I use it for any tourney I run. <br/><br/>I think it's the best idea that telling people being nice wins you things. <br/><br/>Lets say you want to bribe everyone. If they are also in the running for the prize, how much will it cost you to bribe everyone else to vote for you? More than the prize, so that doesn't seem like a good plan.<br/><br/>As the TO, you should be watching the games. You should know who the best sports are, and if a jerk is winning that prize, you'll know the fix is on.<br/><br/>In the dozens of events I ran, it never happened, and the prize kept jumping around to various players. <br/><br/>It created a friendly competitive atmosphere that people came back to week after week.</div>

Re: 'Action' upgrade cards (specifically Counter Attack). <br/><br/>Do you have to declare these as actions in lieu of taking another action? For example: instead of taking an evade token would I declare that I am activating my Counter Attack card and thus if I was attacked later on I would be able to use it? This seems a bit clunky...and more importantly it would mean that you would not attach this card to a low initiative captain because you'd never get a chance to activate it before all your enemies attacked. <br/><br/>Or am I reading too much into this and a card like Counter Attack simply allows you to respond to an attack whenever that occurs and you can take a regular action without committing to the card?</div>

<font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>But how does that work with Counter Attack? I'm actually looking for guidance on the process for different captain initiative ratings? </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>During your activation phase your ship moves at the appropriate time based on your captains skill. Once moved you declare counter-attack as your action for that turn.<br/><br/>Once all ships have moved and taken their actions play moves on to the combat phase starting with the highest ranked captain and working down to the lowest ranked.<br/><br/>This round if you are attacked you will get an immediate FREE attack back unless your ship was destroyed. Regardless as to whether you have already attacked or not.<br/><br/>Basically it is a deterrent to try prevent someone from picking on a specific ship and a punishment if they do.<br/><br/>Consider the case of Toreth on a Valdore with counter attack who is unfortunately facing both Picard and Kirk.<br/><br/>Without counter-attack it is likely that two attacks from captains with a higher skill would destroy the Valdore before it was Toreths turn to attack.<br/><br/>However because Toreth activated Counter Attack as her action she can immediately attack back for free if the first attack doesn't kill her.<br/><br/>If she is then lucky enough to survive the second attack she will be alive to attack when her own turn comes.<br/><br/>Edit: Ninja'd by the previous post but at least I used a different example. </div>

If the IRW Khazara initiates an attack while cloaked on a turn where it uses Counter Attack to attack twice that round, do you receive a buff for both attacks or only the first attack? The Khazara's text says "If you initiate an attack while cloaked, add +1 attack die."<br/><br/>Since there is no "this round" addendum to the end of the text I tend to think both attacks would receive the buff, but figured it was worth asking. While the cloak applies to the End Phase, one could argue the de-cloaking state is not considered to qualify for the Khazara's ability.</div>

In what order are the two attacks resolved, if this is possible?<br/><br/>Kraxon: "Whenever a friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship receives damage you may transfer any amount of that damage to your own Shields, if possible."<br/><br/>Counter Attack: "Action: If your ship's Shields or Hull are damaged by a ship in your forward firing arc this round, you may immediately make 1 free attack against that ship. You may not make this attack if your ship is destroyed."</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Correct, if both ships have Counter Attack, they can both trigger its text in this instance.</div>

Got to play our first game with custom ships and armies today, and wanted to check two things.<br/><br/>1) I was using Khan and my opponent had Martok, both as 8's in terms of Captain Skill. He also had Gowron (6) and I had Picard (9).<br/><br/>For Activation phase, the order would be Gowron (6), Martok (8), Khan (8), and Picard (9), right?<br/>For Combat phase, the order would be Picard (9), Martok (8), Khan (8), and Gowron (6), right?<br/><br/>2) Khan got killed by Martok, but Khan gets a chance to fire as he is an equal Captain Skill and therefore doesn't immediately die, right?<br/><br/>We had a great time today and I can't wait to run the local event next week!</div>

Ok Andrew, rather nitpicky and complicated question about fleet points and squad builds in the OP events.<br/><br/>I built a squad that "cost" me 100 SP by using Pike to make 3 cards 1 point cheaper, so even though it was legal for the build, the SP value showing on the cards was actually 103.<br/><br/>I ended up killing one of my opponent's ships, and he ended up killing one of mine (the ship that Pike had been on when he started, but before he beamed over with one additional crew to DS9). At the time they were destroyed both ships were 23 points of SP <b>on the cards</b>, but the ship and remaining upgrades I lost had contributed only 21 points of cost <b>to my build</b>.<br/><br/>Did we tie? If we tied, would it have been a tie if Pike had stayed on the ship and an equal number of other crew points had beamed off? Or did I actually score more fleet points?<br/><br/>The rules say:<br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Fleet Points are equal to the current month's maximum Fleet Build number MINUS the number of SP left in your opponent's surviving fleet.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I <i>think</i> that means my surviving fleet was 79, and his was 77, which I believe means I actually scored more fleet points.<br/><br/>I'm asking purely for future reference, since last night in the rush of the moment I didn't even remember that Pike had changed the values so we just compared the destroyed SP value as a faster proxy to comparing the remaining SP value. Thanks!</div>

You use the points from your build sheet. So for instance, if you had Data on your crew, you would use 2 (3 - 1 for Pike), not his listed 3. </div>

When using rikers ability does the person need to be in your forward firing arc to be attacked? Also, can the enterprise d fire it's primary weapons using its back arc?</div>

From what I recall in the rules discussions for these, Riker's ability only functions against the first attack against him, but it hits in any direction.  As for the second: The Enterprise D's ability allows it to fire its Primary weapon in a 360 degree arc at range 2 by 'paying' one attack die.  However, it only gets the full 4 attack die from the 90 degree front arc.  The rear arcs on the Galaxy Class and Miranda Class are there to note that they can fire any equipped Photon Torpedoes from there (an ability that the other ships, at the moment, lack) rather than being restricted to the ships forward firing arc.</div>

Hits vs Crits.<br/><br/>Certian cards will say "For every Hit/Damage result you roll, do something" Examples being the Neg'var ability, tractor beam, and DS9 away team battles, all require hit results. <br/><br/>The question: Is a critical hit result (or the double hit from the elite attack die) able to activate these abilities?

Much like Riker's ability, it will only work in retaliation of 1 of the attacks.  You choose when to use it though.  So, if enemy A hits you and you hold off, then B hits you it can be used against B.<br/><br/>Though I imagine this can backfire if you wait and the last ship misses.</div>

Data and Multiple Attacks<br/><br/>Data is worder in a very similar fashion to Montgomery Scott and All Forward Disruptor Banks. How does this interact with Multiple attacks? If I Use Data and Counter Attack in the same turn somehow, do I have to take his -2 attack dice off the first attack I make (whether it be my normal attack or the one from Counter Attack), or does it apply to all attacks this round? Can you apply this effect to some other effect that rolls attack dice like the Negh'var's ability?<br/><br/>Data<br/>Action: Place 2 {EVASION] Tokens beside your ship and reduce your total attack dice by 2 this round. You cannot perform an [EVASION] Action this round, even as a free Action. <br/><br/>Neghvar<br/>Action: Target a ship within your firing arc at Range 1-2 and roll 3 attack dice. For each {damage} result disable 1 of that ship's Shields. If possible, you may play Klingon Boarding Party as a free action this turn. </div>

Is there one source to read the effects of the cards and their stats so I can decide which ships to buy? I am currently buying ships out of fandom for the ship designs and then putting them into my fleets but it would be nice to figure out which ones would be best for my fleets before I buy them.</div>

Hello all!<br/><br/>OK, 2 questions..<br/><br/>1)  Scotty's card reads:<br/><br/> <b>Action:</b> Disable 2 of your Shields in order to gain +2 attack dice this round.<br/><br/><b>OR</b><br/><br/><br/>Repair 1 Shield token and reduce your total attack dice by 2 this round.<br/><br/><br/>Now, my question is, with the spacing and the boldness of the "OR"; is the second half of the card an Action, or is it just an ability that he can do? In other words, are both abilities actions or not? The absence of the action header on the 2nd section makes me think it was by design.<br/><br/><br/>2)  Are there plans to compile all of this into an easily printable and easier to look through document??  11 or 12 pages of posts are not super convenient to scan through.</div>

I have a few questions.<br/><br/>The way I'm understand what has been ruled, and I am sorry if this has been questioned and answered already, when you role 2 less attack die after you use Data, this would only affect the ships first attack even though it says to reduce your total attack dice by 2 this round (Second attack granted by something like Counter Attack). <br/><br/><br/>1. Would this affect crew upgrades like Sulu also? For instance, if my ship is attacked while Sulu is currently adding +2 agility, would the ship still benefit from the +2 agility if a second enemy ship attacks it that same round?<br/><br/>2. Is there a difference between the phrase "this round" and the phrase "for the rest of this round"<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Counter Attack (Romulan/Starter)</b><br/>Action: If you ship's Shields or Hull are damaged by a ship in your forward firing arc this round, you may immediately make 1 free attack against that ship. You may not make this attack if your ship is destroyed.<br/>Cost: 3<br/><br/><b>Data (Federation/Starter)</b><br/>Action: Place 2 {EVASION] Tokens beside your ship and reduce your total attack dice by 2 this round. You cannot perform an [EVASION] Action this round, even as a free Action.<br/>Cost: 3<br/><br/><b>Hikaru Sulu (Federation/USS Enterprise Expansion)</b><br/>ACTION: Add 2 to your Agility for the rest of this round. Each time you defend this round, you may convert 1 (Battle Stations) result into a (Evade) result.<br/>Cost: 3<br/><br/>Thanks for your help! :-)<br/><br/></div>

Steal 1 face up Upgrade Card of your choice from that ship, even if the Upgrade exceeds your ship's restrictions <br/><br/>2) Ferengi EM pulse.<br/><br/>If a ship gets hit by two Ferengi EM pulses in the same turn do the effects stack (ie. 2 Auxiliary tokens and 4 less attack dice that turn)?<br/><br/>Card Text<br/><br/><b>Action:</b> Disable this card to target a ship at Range 1-2 thatis not in your forward firing arc.

Given your answer to the "Superior Intellect" viable targets question I was thinking how to use this and came up with a couple of questions.<br/><br/>1) Can you start the game with your Shields disabled?<br/><br/>2) If you use this method to "transfer" an item from one of your ships to another would the items cost count against the ship it was originally bought for or on the ship it ends up on when determining Fleet Points?</div>

This sort of came up last night, but we were reading the rules incorrectly. However, the scenario we thought came up is still possible...<br/><br/>Opponent has Enterprise D with Kirk, Cheat Death, no shields, undamaged hull (5 points).<br/><br/>I roll an attack of 5 hits and 1 critical. He can't roll defense due to a scan token from my ship.<br/><br/>I place 5 damage cards face down at his ship. This effectively destroys the ship.<br/><br/>I then place a damage card face up for the critical. I turnover a "Injured Captain":<br/><br/>[BGCOLOR=#99CCFF]"You cannot use your Captain's text or any of your (Talent) upgrades."[/BGCOLOR]<br/><br/><br/>The question is; does the 5 damage destroy the ship before the critical hit disables Kirk's abaility to use Cheat Death?</div>

Jason-<br/><br/>Think I may have given some bad advice on this one (I was at the game with Jason last night).<br/><br/>Given the working on the 'Cheat Death' card, it implies all the cards are put onto the ship (and I assume the critical hits take effect) and are then removed one at a time until the ship has only one hull point left.<br/><br/>Even though the critical hits are later flipped over, it would have already have taken effect at the point where it would affect when Cheat Death would be used.<br/><br/>At least that's my read on it now - again, sorry I may have thrown a wrench into things last night.<br/><br/>I'm curious to see Andrew's answer.</div>

Can my opponenet then play his own Klag to detroy MINE even though it is alread discarded?

You only tuck cards under your ship card if you discarded them by using their own card text.<br/><br/>Once they are tucked, they are effectively out of play and cannot be targeted by anything else. They are only there to define scoring at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

For OP Kit 2 can you use both the Command Reroll and the Admiral Reroll from the winner of the First OP.  EI could you get two rerolls(different dice not same dice) as a possibility or can you only use one or the other?  Thanks for you time and the updates are great.</div>

For the dominion EM Pulse<br/><br/>Action: Disable this card to target a ship at Range 1-2. The targeted ship rolls 1 less attack die and 1 less defense die <b>this round.</b> <br/><br/>if I'm attacking the targetted ship multiple times, do they only suffer the defense penalty to the first attack? I'm guessing so because of the "this round" rule, but then why is tractor beam worded so differently?<br/><br/>Action: Target a ship at Range 1 and roll 2 attack dice. For every [DAMAGE] result, that ship rolls 1 less defense die <b>against your next attack.</b> </div>

Also, while I have you here, Is Riker's ability considered an "attack"? would he get bonus attack dice from effects like donatra?<br/><br/>Action: *Once per turn* If you are attacked this round at Range 1, Roll 2 attack dice. Any [DAMAGE] or [CRITICAL] result damages the attacking ship as normal, even if your ship is destroyed by their attack. The attacking ship does not roll any defense dice. </div>

Yes it only affects the next attack.<br/><br/>The difference between EM Pulse and Tractor Beam is that EM Pulse applies if another ship attacks them. Tractor Beam only affects your ship's attack.<br/><br/>No, Riker's ability is not considered an attack.<br/><br/></div>

Ran my first OP event at my FLGS today, and while we all had a blast, there are some questions.<br/><br/>I am confused about how to score things. Luckily, we had someone with 3 wins, someone with 2, someone with 1, and someone with zero, so no issues on placing.<br/><br/>In my first game, I flew 100 points and my opponent flew 98. I didn't lose any ships and controlled DS9 at the end. I believe that means I put "W" in the W-L-B column, 100 in the "Your fleet points" column, and 2 in the "Cumulative Fleet points" column. I'm not sure where the 10 points for controlling DS9 goes.<br/><br/>Also, I'm not sure how the tie breaking works. I don't see where battle points go on the sheet. I know that the players have 10, 6, 5, and 4 Battle points respectively, but not where that's recorded on the sheets. The winner gets 2 points for each win, 1 point for attending, and 3 for winning the event. Each other player gets 2 Battle points per win, and 1 for attending and one for each loss.<br/><br/>Finally, as we had four players, we just determined that each player was in their own faction, as I see no rules saying players have to maintain their factions. Each player got to take home a set of the mines and wormhole tokens.<br/><br/>Can any other TO's comment on this? </div>

The easiest way I saw on the forums here is it's the Riddick rule: you keep what you kill! So if you wipe out an enemy fleet its 100 fleet points. if it goes to time or you lose but you destroyed 1 ship worth 45 points, you get 45 fleet points.<br/><br/>Cumulative Fleet points is your the sum of all your fleet points rewards. so if you won your first round by destroying the enemy without capturing the station, you should have 100 points and 100 cumulative points. After the second round, if you destroy the enemy fleet again but ALSO control DS9, you get 110 fleet points, or 210 cumulative with the last round.<br/><br/>Battle points aren't directly recorded on the sheet, you just count up the W's and L's and convert to a number afaik. Tie Breakers happen if Battle Points are tied (for example if two players went 2-1). The winner between them would be who accumulated the most Fleet Points during the tourney.<br/><br/>Sounds like everyone got some cool swag though, so I'd comment that your tournament seemed to go rather smoothly :-)<br/><br/>EDIT: In your example first round, if you had jus tstopped and not destroyed anything of either fleet, you would get 2 fleet points for free and be considered the "winner". the 2 is considered "part of" your fleet points you get for free because your opponent didn't use them. Completely annihaltating your opponent would have gotten you exactly 100. if something weird had happened like you went to time and only destroyed 40 points worth of his stuff, you'd get credited for 40+2 points of stuff for your Fleet Points.</div>

2 questions<br/><br/> First, do independent cards require a faction penalty? example: putting Follows of Kahn on the Negh'var. Does it cost 1 or 2 points?<br/><br/> Second, If I have Clark Terell range 1 of a friendly Negh'var ship, do I get +1 def dice on just the first attack that the Negh'var received, or against all attacks upon the Negh'var?<br/><br/>The first question, I assume its 2 points, the second question I can see it going either way... However since its not an action, and does not use the word 'round' I assume its constant.<br/></div>

Tried the OP Month 2 tonight and two questions came up:<br/><br/>1. Do OWPs get the +1 attack die bonus for Range 1?<br/><br/>2. What rules are used for choosing sides?  Since there are obstacles to be placed, this may make a difference in the game.<br/><br/>According to the Setup instructions, it says after Debris Tokens are placed to return to the "Standard 2 player rules" on page 6.  However, those rules do not seem to address choosing sides.  <br/><br/>The "Adding Obstacles to a Standard Game" section under Advanced Rules does seem to address choosing sides.  Is that what should be followed?<br/><br/>Thx!</div>

Hi, After playing in the Month 1 event, I have a question about destroyed points. (I would like to know as I am playing in another in a couple of weeks).<br/><br/>The USS Enterprise has an away team on the station and it consists of a skill 1 captain and a 5 point crew member.<br/><br/>During the game the crew stay on the station and the Enterprise is destroyed, the game then ends due to time.<br/><br/>Does the away teams point value still count for scoring the destroyed Enterprise?<br/><br/>Thanks.</div>

@Isaac : #1 - Yes.  Independents cost +1 unless on an independent ship.  Khan's ability allows him to negate this cost on any upgrades to his ship. But not to his cost to be added to the ship.<br/><br/>#2 - not sure, but I think you are correct that it grants a +1 Defense against all attacks (that was how they played it at our OP).  Other than against his own ship.<br/></div>

Player with the most battlestations on a roll chooses which side they start on.<br/><br/>If you mean who starts placing debris fields first, that seems to be determined by initiative. <br/>Starting is based on lowest squadron points first (p.21 lwr left corner), then by faction initiative stated on p.18 of the rulebook.<br/><br/>Placement alternates from there.<br/><br/>As for Question #1? <br/>I've been assuming they're like plasma torpedos and so don't get a bonus to range.</div>

A question on fleet points when time is up came up last night.  When totalling up fleet points, the rule is <b>"Fleet Points are equal to the current month's maximum Fleet Build number MINUS the number of SP left in your opponent's surviving fleet."</b> The question was does a resource (i.e. Elite Attack Die) count towards your surviving fleet SP total.<br/><br/>So, If my surviving fleet total is 45 with 5 SP resource, my opponent would have 55 fleet points. <br/><br/>My opponent's surviving fleet total is 42 but no resource, I would get 58 fleet points and win when time was up.  <br/><br/>If the resource does not count, then my surviving fleet would be 40 my opponent would have 60 fleet points and I would lose.</div>

Are the 1 [Straight] maneuver templates supposed to be the length of a ship base front to back?<br/><br/>For example if two ships are facing each other and Ship A moves first and maneuvers into Ship B and must stop by touching Ship B, and then Ship B reveals a 1 [Straight], will Ship B be able to move past Ship A?<br/><br/>Conceptually it seems so, but when i actually hold up the 1 [Straight] template it doesn't seem to get past Ship A.<br/><br/>If it does, are they touching after the move?<br/><br/>Maybe the confusion is the part of the base that "sticks out" past where the templates touch the base?  <br/><br/>Thx!</div>

(There was 5 at mine)<br/><br/><br/>Total side note:<br/>Out of the 4 I'm connected with, only 2 are really trying to make a community I think.  I would consider "making a community" a store that has play nights that aren't OP events.  The other two - the only time they play is when they do an OP event.  I really hope more stores do other nights and encourage it.  I've collected up a few heroclix models (like the cloaked defiant) and am making prizes for the next night I do mine.  There's going to be a 50 point head to head tourney, and I'm going to give away a modified micro machine enterprise to the first person to complete the Kobayashi Maru mission against my Klingon fleet.  </div>

Sorry if this has been answered, but I have q questions about re-rolls.  Let's say I'm playing Krell (a Klingon captain who "when attacking, you may re-roll one of your battlestations results) loaded on the Krayton (ACTION:  disable 1 of your active shields to gain +1 attack die this round; you may re-roll all of your blanks one time).<br/><br/>Let's say I take the Krayton's action and roll 2 blanks, a hit, and a battlestations.  I re-roll the battlestations (per Krell's ability) and it comes up blank.  Can I then re-roll all blanks?  And let's say one of those blank re-rolls is another battlestations.  Can I then re-roll one of the battlestations per Krell's ability?  I understand this can lead to a perpetual loop, so what is the correct order of re-rolls for this synergy? </div>

Hello,<br/> I have a quick question regarding the Reliant's passive (You gain +1 attack die when firing at range 1)<br/><br/>I want to know if this would stack with Antimatter Mines in the following scenario or at all: <br/><br/>I fly past my opponent who is now in my rear Arc range 1. I then do my actions like scan. During the Attack phase I use Antimatter Mines and drop them on top of my opponents ship.  <br/><br/>Would I roll 4 dice like is printed on the card or would I get to roll 5 due to the Reliant's passive. <br/><br/>Follow up question, if I were to drop two Antimatter Mine tokens from two ships onto one ship would both attacks trigger? Or would the opponent ship have immunity from the second attack?<br/><br/>Thanks,</div>

Andrew - thanks so much for all your time answering our questions!<br/><br/>Now, of course, I have a question as well.  When a Captain card is disabled can their Elite Talent(s) still be used?<br/><br/>Also a minor suggestion, you may want to break out the Resource questions (Elite Die and Command Tokens) at the top of the OP section since they can be used over the course of the various OPs (if I understand correctly).  Right now it doesn't matter much, but I imagine as we approach Month 6 of the OP it may be helpful.</div>

So the min/maxer in me has some questions on the new card in the Klingon prize ship from OP2:<br/><br/>"Barrage of Fire:<br/>Attack:  Discard this card to perform this attack.  Target 1 friendly ship within range 1 of your ship.  Target ship may not make a normal attack this round.  Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack.  Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside both ships"<br/><br/>1.  It looks like your friendly ship that is targeted can still make a secondary attack, true?<br/><br/>2.  When adding the Primary Weapon value of your friendly ship, does that mean any additions to your primary weapon value are also included?  Ex:  Donatra, Gowron, N'Vek (Action:  disable 1 of your active shields to +1 attack die this round)</div>

Pretty sure I haven't seen this question through all of the pages so far.<br/><br/>My question is dealing with attacking through obstacles.<br/><br/>Pg 22 of the rulebook has this:<br/><pre>When measuring range during combat, if any part of the Range Ruler between the two ships overlaps an obstacle, <br/>the attack is considered obstructed.  Because of this obstruction, the defender rolls one additional defense die <br/>during the "Roll Defense Dice" step of this attack.</pre><br/><br/>That's all fine, and that's understood.  I noticed recently that the X-Wing rulebook states the same rule, except they now have a clarification on it in their FAQ.  Their clarification is: "When measuring range during combat, if the edge of the range ruler <i>between the closest points of the two ships</i> overlaps an obstacle token, the attack is considered obstructed"<br/><br/>So my question: Are there any clarifications to this rule in Attack Wing?  I can understand this coming up a bit more often in the other game with the large base ships.  That's currently not a situation with Attack Wing, so perhaps the clarification is not needed?  However, I'm just hunting for differences in the rules between the two games (another example in X-Wing you can't attack a ship that is touching your ship's base vs. Attack Wing you can attack the ship with a touching base).<br/><br/>I guess the same question would be applied to planets as well.  Is the complete obstruction measured by shortest point to shortest point or any point on the base to any point on the base?<br/><br/>Edit: Here's the source that I used for the X-Wing FAQ <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/x-wing/support/faq/X-Wing-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/x-wing/support...</a></div>

When squad building, is there any restriction on having two identical non-unique weapon upgrades on one ship, assuming you can pay the cost and the ship has the available slots?<br/><br/>Example: I have the Gor Portas (Breen Battle Cruiser) with 2 Energy Dissipator.<br/><br/>There was a player in one of our local tournaments who ran that configuration, and several players (mostly those who lost to said player) cried foul with the build, but since no rule regarding duplicate upgrades exists, outside of the Unique rule, the build seemed legal.<br/><br/>Did I make the correct ruling, or was I mistaken?<br/><br/>Thanks</div>

So the ability for the FDB card only acts on the ship's base forward firing arc, not for any additional firing arc an ability gives them.<br/>So the 360 degree firing ability the Enterprise D has doesn't convert to a 180 degree forward firing arc for the FDB card text.<br/><br/>Understood.

Data's text is an action that specifically states you "cannot perform the evasive maneuvers actions this turn". That is the only specific case in this ruling. you can target lock or battlestations or whatever you want with your second action as long as it's not evasive maneuvers (or trying to activate data again).<br/><br/>Don't separate "ship" and "crew" actions. it's just "actions"</div>

Well that does make sense, but I'm still pretty certain you can only have 1 named iteration of a character per fleet.<br/><br/>Though I wonder if it'd be weird to have Kor, the Dahar master, and the generic Klingon captain who we all know as Kor (aka the "original" Balthazar)in the same fleet.<br/><br/>The Dahar master should give a +2 to agility at least.</div>

I don't think that is the case with the EAD.<br/>The mines are an automatic attack, like when you run into an obstacle, or the text on the crit hit cards that say roll an attack die for damage.<br/><br/>I don't think you can use the EAD for the minefields, cloaked or otherwise.<br/>I think it only applies to ship attacks.</div>

We have been using the EAD for the dropped anti matter mines if we drop it directly on a ship because it is an "attack" and different than an obstacle. Since it serves as an attack when you first use the card (and prevents me from making an attack with my primary weapon for example) I would hope you could use the EAD for those Federation mines when they are first dropped on an enemy ship.

I don't know; the rules text states "...You may choose to substitute the EAD for one of your attack dice this round..."<br/><br/>It doesn't specify that they have to be used for a ship attack. As written, it seems to say that you can substitute for any one attack die (that you roll, as opposed to one your opponent rolls) per round, which would include mines, ship abilities like the Negh'Var's, and so on...</div>

Not sure if this has already been asked/answered (I searched and could not find it), but I have a question about the Apnex's action:<br/><br/>Action (once/game): Every ship at range 1 sustains 1 damage (including this ship). During the Planning Phase this ship must choose a '1' Maneuver (forward, bank or turn) for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>I take it to mean 1 damage, exactly as if it were rolled, meaning that if a ship has any shields remaining and active they would absorb this hit. Another player said he thought the Apnex's hits bypassed shields and went straight to the hull. Which is correct?<br/><br/>And BTW, thanks for designing an awesome game! My daughter, my son and I are enjoying it tremendously!<br/><br/></div>

Hey Andrew! Thanks for making such an awesome game!!! Thanks for taking all these questions as well! I had two questions about squad building for you.<br/>1: in page twenty one of the rule book it states that"if all players agree than each player may play with ships from multiple factions. Players may even combine captains and upgrades from multiple factions on the same ship if they are willing to pay the faction penalty..." Now does this mean that Kahn and any other independent captains in the future cannot be played if all players don't agree to mix factions?<br/>2: i'm assuming that the independent factions always incur a penalty in cost because they don't have any ship of there faction. Someone suggested to me they don't get one because they are "independent". I didn't think so, but now I have that tiny seed of doubt I'm my mind, and if nothing else we'll have a disagreement every time we play.<br/>Thanks again Andrew! I'm addicted to this game!</div>

One more question from a newcomer to the game, please:<br/><br/>This may be an obvious one, but I'd like a clarification on the following. In a game last night, it was argued that overlapping means that a ship cannot perform an action, but that a free action from a captain (Picard) was allowed, since the overlap rule states: Skip this <i>ship's</i> perform action steps. Since the free action was not coming from the ship itself, it should be allowed.<br/><br/>Based on my reading of the FAQ (5. If a ship overlaps another ship or obstacle, can it still perform free Actions? No. A ship that loses the ability to perform Actions also loses the ability to perform free Actions.) it seems to me that it does not matter <i>where </i>the actions are coming from, an overlapped ships gets NO actions that turn. I take it that since the ship has to skip the perform action step, it is irrelevant where the actions come from.<br/><br/>Which interpretation is correct? Thanks!<br/><br/></div>

If a player wins initiative because they have lower squad points, and have 2 captains of the same skill but are from different factions, does that plate get to choose which one to move first/fire first, or do they have to follow the faction order at that point?<br/><br/>Such as Picard and Gen Con Khan in the same force, but coming in at 2 squad points less than their opponent.<br/><br/>thanks!</div>

Andrew,<br/><br/>This rather odd question came up in my OP month 1 tournament.<br/><br/>My opponent and I were both going straight for DS9, and my opponent does his awesome Klingon combo with the "klingon Boarding Party" action so all of my guys on my one ship got "disabled."<br/><br/>now at this point we look at it as kind of an "auxiliary power" token of sorts. We know that you can acquire multiple auxiliary power tokens through critical hits or various effects...<br/><br/>So next maneuver, I decide to move into range of DS9 and "disable" my already "disabled" cards to beam onto DS9...<br/><br/>Can I do that?<br/><br/>We were very confused as to if this was possible. What we ended up doing was allowing this to be possible, BUT if I was to beam them back onto their ship I would need to take multiple actions to remove the multiple "disabled" tokens.<br/><br/>Is this a fair assessment of how this might work? Or can a crew or captain upgrade ONLY EVER have 1 "Disabled" token on it?<br/><br/>Just thought this was interesting enough to add to the overall FAQ.</div>

This works differently than Auxiliary Power Tokens.<br/><br/>If a card is disabled, it cannot be disabled again. So if the Klingon Boarding Party disables your Crew, you cannot beam them onto DS9.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Thanks again for taking the time to answer our questions Andrew. I've got some more for the pile.<br/><br/>You mentioned earlier that resources count towards the surviving fleet points total. If player 1's fleet is wiped out, does player 2 score points for player 1's resource? Seems odd if you could only score 95 points on someone using the EAD.<br/><br/>If a ship cloaks as its action, and then is given a second action- say, from Picard or Martok- can it sensor echo? My instinct is yes, but the rulebook mentions 'a previous turn' in its phrasing.<br/><br/>If a player has multiple ships of the same pilot skill and faction, is there a hard-and-set order they should move/fire those ships in? Or can they move/fire the ships in any order they like? What order should I move my swarms of skill 1 goobers in?<br/><br/>You mentioned earlier that a disabled captain drops his pilot skill to 1. If a pilot skill changes like this partway through the round- for example Weyoun(skill 6) disabling himself to protect his crew from a skill 3 ship's boarders, or Chang(skill 6) disabling a skill 9 captain- when do the freshly disabled captains act in that phase?</div>

Hey Andrew i have a few questions that could use some clarification<br/><br/>1) If i use suicide attack against a ship that is cloaked, does that ship roll the 4 extra dice?<br/><br/>2) If a ship uses suicide attack with cheat death will the ship come back with full shields (assuming it didnt recieve any damage) and will that ship be able to attack that turn?<br/><br/>3) If a ship uses an energy dissipator for a counter attack and hits will that ship be able to attack again?<br/><br/>4) If i understand the tournament rules right if i use suicide attack and my ship doesnt revive my opponent will get points for that ship even though they didnt destroy it.<br/><br/>Suicide Attack<br/>ACTION: At the end of the activation phase, you must make a 1^ maneuver and place an Auxilary Power Token beside your ship, destroy your ship and roll 8 attack dice to damage the enemy ship. That ship rolls defense dice against this attack.<br/><br/><br/>Counter Attack<br/>ACTION: Once per turn if your ship's shields or hull are damaged by a ship in your forward firing arc this round, you may immediately make 1 free attack against that ship. you may not make this attack if your ship was destroyed.<br/><br/></div>

Definite yes, the rules state that the points for the loser of the game are calculated as 100-the value of ships+upgrades still in play. So if you take command tokens or elite attack die you are handing your opponent 5pts.</div>

Question regarding performing a free action:<br/><br/>This came up last night in a casual game.  When Martok allows a friendly ship to perform a free action, are the free actions limited to the actions in the ship's action bar, or could they perform an action that a crew member or ship special ability allows?  For example:<br/><br/>Martok is on the Maht-H'a, and he has Nu'Daq on the Negh'Var and Gowron on a Vor'Cha class both at range 2 from the Maht-H'a.  Assuming that neither the Negh'Var's ability nor Gowron's ability were used during their perform action step, could Martok allow the use of the Negh'Var ability or Gowron's ability as the free action?  (Assuming of course that the Negh'Var and Vor'Cha ships didn't overlap or can't perform actions for any other reason.)<br/><br/>I thought it was allowed, but another player disagreed because page 12 of the rule book reads "Some card abilities include the 'Action:' header.  A ship may resolve this ability during it's 'Perform Action' step."  It seems to me that a free action is any available action that hasn't already been performed.<br/><br/>What's the correct ruling?</div>

When Martok allows a friendly ship to perform a free action, are the free actions limited to the actions in the ship's action bar, or could they perform an action that a crew member or ship special ability allows?  For example:<br/><br/>Martok is on the Maht-H'a, and he has Nu'Daq on the Negh'Var and Gowron on a Vor'Cha class both at range 2 from the Maht-H'a.  Assuming that neither the Negh'Var's ability nor Gowron's ability were used during their perform action step, could Martok allow the use of the Negh'Var ability or Gowron's ability as the free action?  (Assuming of course that the Negh'Var and Vor'Cha ships didn't overlap or can't perform actions for any other reason.)<br/><br/>I thought it was allowed, but another player disagreed because page 12 of the rule book reads "Some card abilities include the 'Action:' header.  A ship may resolve this ability during it's 'Perform Action' step."  It seems to me that a free action is any available action that hasn't already been performed.<br/><br/>What's the correct ruling?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>You were correct.

Quick question:<br/><br/>For Captain Gorkon, it says, "every ship that attacks you this round rolls 2 less attack dice."<br/><br/>So I assume that the Orbital Weapon platforms in month 2 tournament are not considered a "ship" and thus can still roll 4 dice instead of 2?

Howdy, folks.<br/><br/>After discussing with Chris Guild, I have re-evaluated my answer regarding overlapping trigger zones for Cloaked Mines. Here is the entry I added to the FAQ:<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/><b>11. If the trigger areas for two Cloaked Mines overlap, does an enemy ship passing through the overlapping trigger area sustain damage from both Cloaked Mines?</b></font><br/><br/>No. In this case the ship would only be damaged by one of the Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/>However, if a ship passes through (and completely out of) the trigger area of one Cloaked Mine and into the trigger area of another Cloaked Mine, then the ship sustains damage from both Cloaked Mines.<br/><br/>------------------------<br/><br/>Thematically, the reason why your own ships can pass safely through a Cloaked Minefield is that you are able to see their energy signature and fly in between them, which means they are purposefully set up to not be densely packed. This is the reason why the Scan Action helps mitigate the effects of a Cloaked Minefield, as it helps the enemy ship get a loose reading on the mines' locations.<br/><br/>Mechanically, it was never the intention of this card to create a zone of absolute death (which would happen if enough of them were overlapping). The intention of allowing multiples was to spread the Cloaked Minefield further out and to increase the damage to ships travelling through the multiple zones (not to annihilate a ship passing through a dense clump of them).<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Andrew<br/><br/></div>

On the subject of cloaked mines, the card says "passes within range 1..." of the mines.  Does this include the opponent's movement template in the consideration? Or only his final position?<br/><br/>Also, if the opponent fails to move out of range 1 from the cloaked minefield on a subsequent move,  would he suffer another damage roll?

Can the attack dice rolled for Antimatter Mines be modified in any way?<br/><br/>Yes, but only when you drop the Minefield Token directly on top of another ship. In this case, the number of attack dice can be altered by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra; you may also substitute the Elite Attack Die for one of the normal attack dice.<br/><br/>Could the effects of Drex or Spock also affect the attack dice (i.e., turn all [battlestations] to [hits])? I thought I read something along those lines not too long ago.</div>

Yes, Drex and Spock are good in this circumstance. You just can't spend your actual Battle Stations, Target Lock, or Evade Tokens because the Antimatter Mines forgo the normal Combat sequence.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Since they happen at the same time, you can choose the order that they go.

A ship being destroyed is one triggering event analogous to a scan token as one triggering event. A scan token can only trigger Mr. Spock <u>or</u> Geordi La Forge, not both cards.  Therefore, how can one destruction trigger <u>two</u> cards for the same player?<br/><br/>The ISAT and CD combo has reached the absurd level. I played against an opponent who used Kirk with CD and ISAT.<br/><br/><b>Cheat Death</b> states:<br/>If your ship was <b><u>just</u></b> destroyed, discard this card to remove Damage Cards one at a time from your Ship Card until the amount of damage is 1 point less than your Hull Value. Flip all remaining Damage Cards face down.

These ships do not roll defense dice against this damage. (Emphasis added.)<br/><br/>Kirk used ISAT and he rolled 2 hits. Dealing 2 hits each to two of my ships within range one. Kirk then used CD to return with one hull point remaining. My second ship destroyed Kirk again, only to have ISAT trigger again. He rolled 2 more hits again (what are the odds!). This combo dealt 4 hits EACH to two of my ships, which could not roll ANY defense dice either time. <br/><br/>The destruction of a ship should only be able to trigger ISAT <u>or</u> CD, not both for the same destruction. Otherwise, Mr. Spock <u>and</u> Geordi La Forge, and other similar combos, should be permissible.</div>

the inability to be used with multiple tokens is a specific rule that only applies to scan tokens (and other action tokens though no cards use this yet: as is explained in the rulebook, page 22, pargraph 4). every card that uses them is basically a scan-enhancing ability. In another way: You can't have two different people using the same sensors for different purposes at the same time. ("Get out of my way! I need to run an antiproton scan", "no you get out of my way so I can lock on to their ion trail with a baryon sweep", fisticuffs ensue}.<br/><br/>Everything else can trigger just fine from the same initial event triggering multiple cards. Like when you attack, you can use Breen Aide, Toreth, AND Drex (if you had enough actions to use them all) even though they are all things that trigger on an attack. </div>

Hey guys, I have a question about the Ferengi's EM Pulse (Tech Upgrade).<br/><br/>The card text reads: <b>Action:</b> Disable this card to target a ship at range 1-2 that is not in your forward firing arc. Place an Auxiliary Power token beside the target ship. The target ship rolls two less attack dice this round.<br/><br/>I just want to confirm that if I have a lower captain skill, and play this action before my opponent has had a chance to move the target ship, and he reveals a red maneuver, I get to choose his maneuver as per the rules on page 19. (Which makes this potentially quite a bit nastier that I first thought!)<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/></div>

I've got a question concerning the Cloaked Mines from the upcoming I.R.W. Praetus expansion. The card text states:<br/><br/>"<i>During the Planning Phase, you may discard this card to place...</i>"<br/><br/>When exactly during the Planning Phase does this get played? It would make a big difference in its impact if it were played before people had their maneuver dials set as opposed to afterwards.</div>

Can the ds9 (which is now under my control) take a battle station action? the ds9 is now pilot skill 1....<br/>a counter argument that was made (and I agree with) is that the ds9 has already went through its activation at pilot skill 0, and thus wont get to take a second activation at pilot skill 1...

Hey Andrew, another question here. Can you run a suicide attack with the upcoming jem'hadar patrol ship, and then play cheat death to preserve the ship?</div>

Another question about the jem'hadar. The crew upgrade Virak'Kara says "disable this card and one crew upgrade of your choice on the target ship... you may then use that upgrades action as a free action this round". Now here is my question: the card does not specify if the ship is enemy or friendly. Could it be used to borrow an action from a friendly? I don't think this was the intention, but I thought I would ask.</div>

I'm sorry if I missed it elsewhere, but during OP2 do the OWPs count as ships concerning the placement of Cloaked Mines?<br/><br/>Cloaked Mines: "During the planning phase, you may discard this card to place a Minefield Token within range 2 of your ship (in any direction), but not within range 2 of an enemy ship. If an enemy ship passes within range 1 of the token, roll 3 attack dice (-1 if the target ship immediately performs a [scan] action). Any [hit] or [crit] damages the target ship as normal. The affected ship does not roll any defense dice."</div>

Here's one I feel certain someone must have asked but I can't find it.<br/><br/>The final line of Counter Attack reads:<br/><br/>"You man not make this free attack if your ship is destroyed."<br/><br/>Just want to make sure that the Simultaneous Attack Rule does override this line if it is in effect (the way it was worded separately like that make me second guess).<br/><br/>Thx!<br/><br/></div>

For Suicide Attack,<br/><br/>If you use suicide attack and overlap more than one enemy ship, can you roll the suicide attack dice more than once? Or do you have to choose a single enemy ship to hit? Is there a choice of what to hit at all or do you HAVE to hit the first ship you'd encounter?<br/><br/>By the same note, if you survive your own suicide attack with cheat death, where does your ship end up? still overlapping, or would it follow the regular movement rules and end up touching the first ship it encountered?<br/><br/></div>

Question that came up during a tourney: If I have a cloaked ship with photons and a target lock on an enemy ship and I decide that I'm going to attack them with said torpedoes, but the player uses Conditional Surrender, do I lose my lock, my cloak, and do my torpedoes become disabled? My guess is yes, but wanted to make sure.<br/><br/>Conditional Surrender (Ferengi/ LE Krayton Pack)<br/>When your ship is attacked, before any dice are rolled, discard all of your [CREW] Upgrades to cancel the attack.

Picard would be okay but not Martok.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>This question came up tonight during our month 2 OP Event and is slightly different than what has been discussed above so far. I just scrolled down through all 23 pages of the FAQ and did not find an answer that seems to apply, so I am asking for clarification.  Here goes....<br/><br/>If a ship with Martok as the captain overlaps another ship during Martok's movement phase, he has to back up along the movement template until he no longer overlaps the other ship and then loses his action. HOWEVER, does Martok's special text ability to give a friendly ship within range 1-2 a free action still get to be used?  I know Martok cannot give a ship that has overlapped another ship or lost its action phase the free action his ability grants. But.....does he (ie. Martok) himself lose the power to give away a free action to a friendly ship if his own ship overlaps someone else and Martok's ship loses it's actions.<br/><br/>in the example tonight:<br/><br/>player 1 has a Defiant with Martok (skill 8) and a Khazara with Donatra (skill 6). He moves the Khazara with Donatra captaining it, then moves the Defiant with Martok captaining it and happens to overlap player#2's Kronos One.  So he pulls Martok's Defiant back along the movement template until it no longer overlaps player#2's Kronos One.  Because the Defiant overlapped another ship, the Defiant cannot use it's action.  But can Martok still give Donatra a free action if she is within range 1-2 per the special text on his card?  <br/><br/>In this case Martok is not trying to give another ship that lost it's action phase a free action, he is trying to use his ability to give away a free action while captaining a ship that lost its own action during the movement phase. Can he still do that?<br/><br/>card text for Martok: <br/>"After you move, choose 1 friendly ship within range 1-2 whose captain skill has a lower skill than Martok's. The chosen ship may immediately perform 1 free action."<br/><br/><br/>Thanks in advance for your help.</div>

Card text is unaffected when moving into an obstacle. You simply cannot perform Actions. Since Martok's text is not an Action, he may still use his text in this situation.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Andrew, we need a clarification when you get a chance.  <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"><br/><br/>Sulu's text says:<br/><br/>ACTION: Add 2 to your Agility for the rest of this round.  Each time you defend this round, you may convert one BATTLESTATIONS into an EVASIVE MANEUVERS result.<br/><br/>Now with the "this round" clarification from earlier posts, how does it work exactly with Sulu?  Because if we take into account previous rulings/wordings, then I could read his text as two parts: the first half as increasing the agility by 2 "this round" (meaning one time only) and then the second sentence as a separate continual effect that happens against every attack.<br/><br/>If that isn't the intention, though, it's "this round" that is starting to cause confusion since round in this game doesn't mean "turn."<br/><br/></div>

Hi,<br/><br/>when I was thinking about strategies for defeating the Scimitar scenario, I quickly found the Muon Feedback Wave:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i><b>Action:</b> Discard this card to place a Muon Token beside a ship at Range 1.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>The rules for the Muon Token state:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>1. A Muon Token stays with a ship until it is removed.<br/><br/>2. During the <b>Activation Phase,</b> after the ship moves, the ship takes damage to its Hull equal to the number of its current Maneuver -1. The type of Maneuver does not matter, just the number.<br/><br/>3. After the ship performes a Green or White Maneuver, it can spend an Action to remove the Muon Token.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Now, there are no limitations regarding taking the action when either the Romulan Science Vessel or its target are cloaked, so the Romulan Science Ship may "infect" the Scimitar very early in the scenario.<br/><br/>The Scimitar always moves with a straight 3, i.e. it will take 2 points of damage to its hull each round. (Unless its shields are destroyed, in which case it moves 2 for 1 point of hull damage.):<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>1) The Scimitar does not make a normal move. During the Planning Phase, shuffle the Hidden Movement tokens (HMTs) face down and place each token face down beside a different side of the Scimitar Token. Then it is the Scimitar's turn to move, flip over all of the HMTs, remove the "Echo" Tokens, and place the --> 3 Maneuver Template on the side of the ship where the "Actual" Token was located. Then remove the "Actual" Token and move the Scimitar Token using that Maneuver Template. [...]</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Also, the "program" of the Scimitar does not allow it to choose an Action to remove the Muon Token. It will always take a Battle Stations Token for an additional attack die.<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>2) After it moves, place a Battle Stations Token beside the ship. This token must be used when the Scimitar attacks.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>With 8 hull the Scimitar will be destroyed in roughly four turns after being infected, even if the players decide not to engage it with any other weapons.<br/><br/>This seems like an unintended shortcut through the scenario.</div>

If you put two (or more?) Tactical Officers on a single ship, would their abilities stack? That is, would spending a single Target Lock allow not just two re-rolls, but three (or more)?<br/><br/>Text from Tactical Officer:<br/><br/>"When removing your Target Lock from an opposing ship in order to re-roll your attack dice, you may re-roll each attack die one additional time."</div>

Okay, quetion regarding command tokens:<br/><br/>When can you use command tokens? Can it be anytime during the round? Or do I have to declare it during a particular ships action phase? <br/><br/>For example, can I give my ship an evade token when my opponent declares an attack against it?

The Command Tokens come with a card explaining when each of the tokens should be played.<br/><br/>Basically:<br/><br/>4 of them represent Free Actions and so would have to be played using all the normal rules for Actions.<br/><br/>2 of them are re-rolls (1 attack and 1 defence) so you can choose to use these after rolling the appropriate dice.<br/><br/>4 of them influence an attack/defence roll that is about to happen and you use the token immediately prior to rolling the dice.<br/><br/>As already mentioned though you may only use 1 per round so if you have already used one to get a free action you can't then use a second later on to re-roll an attack dice roll, etc.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.

For the OP3 event is 'battle score' the same as 'battle points'? For example if I win the game and control Ar-558 I would come up with 3 total points on the round?<br/><br/>"BONUS: If the winning player controls AR-558 (see above) at the end of the Battle, that player receives an additional +1 Battle Score"<br/><br/>"BATTLE POINTS: At the end of every Battle Round, players receive BATTLE POINTS based on their performance in that Battle Round (2 PTS for a Win, 2 PTS for a Bye and 1 PT for a Loss).

Question about Barrage of Fire:<br/><br/>[4 dice] Attack: (1-2 Range) Discard this card to perform this attack. Target 1 friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship. Target ship may not make a normal attack this round. Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack. Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside both ships. <br/><br/>Does the secondary attack ship have to be at the same range as the primary attack ship when making the attack or does the range not matter as long as it has the target ship in its firing arc? Also if the secondary ship is cloaked, does it come out of cloak or not since this was not a normal attack?<br/><br/>Thanks!</div>

<b>OP3 - Simultaneous Attack</b><br/><br/>Does the simultaneous attack rule apply in any form to the planet forces in OP3?<br/><br/>To be more clear:  2 Level 6 Captains fighting each other.

Regarding the cloaked mines, a question was raised.<br/>Assuming that you went BOP happy on the Romulan warbird and had several cloaked mines, could you drop ALL of the mines at the start of the same round?<br/><br/>IE, you have Khazara with 1 cloaked mines and the Praetus with 2 cloaked mines, can they drop all 3 of them at the same time?<br/>Would the mines have to observe the "2 away from" rule amongst themselves as well as ships (I'm thinking no)?<br/><br/>But not sure if you can do all 3 at once in this scenario as that isn't an actual action step and it is done before movement.</div>

OP Month 3 questions:<br/><br/>1. How many ships are you allowed to have? Description of the rules seems to imply only one ship with some of the text, multiple ships in other parts of the rules text<br/><br/>2. If multiple ships, do all the ground forces token have to be "on" just one of your ships, or can you spread them out over your fleet?<br/><br/>3. If the ship the ground tokens are on gets destroyed before all the ground tokens are deployed, are those tokens lost?<br/><br/>4. Are the SAMs only triggered with the loss of your ground troops? To rephrase, can you trigger the SAMs even if you've not lost any troops in an attack exchange?<br/><br/>5. The rules text says that to place ground troops on the planet you must disable all your shields if your ship is not cloaked. Does that mean cloaked ships can't deploy troops?<br/><br/>6. At the end of a combat round resolution, if you are cloaked and the cloak doesn't have to come down because you've not fired that round, can you raise shields as part of the combat resolution so as to de-cloak? Or will you have had to attack to get the cloak to disengage?<br/><br/>7. While the rules make no mention of it, for clarification purposes, is it correct to assume that you can't bombard the enemy troops from orbit with a ship attack?<br/><br/>Those are the ones that come to mind right now reading the rules.<br/>Thanks.</div>

1. If part of a ships movement takes a part of the ship off the board but the completion of the movement brings it fully onto the board, does the ship still leave play? Has a ship that has left play count as being destroyed for fleet points?<br/><br/>2. For the command pips as part of the participation prize for month 2, one of the abilities allow you to place a target lock as a free action. Can I place one on a ship that has been fully cloaked or does it just allow me to do it? <br/><br/>3. When using advanced squad rules, it states that initiative goes to the player with fewer squadron points. Am I correct in assuming this would only matter if you are considering captains of equal skill level? For instance if two players each were using Picard, than the initiative would go to the player who has 99 points in their build. </div>

Hi<br/>Do the OPII weapons platforms count as ships for the purposes of laying cloaked mines? It states they are ships for card text purposes so as written the implication would be yes they do. Question came up a lot in our OP.<br/><br/>Also just clarifying - a ship in the cloaked mine zone does not take damage if it moves out the following turn (as per normal mine token rules) is that right? If it is what happens if it moves but stays within the zone for some reason - would it be attacked again?<br/><br/>Also checking if the text stating 'enemy ships' is indeed deliberate and means that friendly ships can fly through the mine zone without triggering them?<br/><br/>Cheers</div>

Clearly from the FAQ answer they count as ships, and the card uses the term "enemy" ships. Now if you can't place the mine field with range 2 because they count as "enemy" ships that leave very few options to a legal placing on the mines on the play area.<br/><br/>However if the OWP counted as Neutral and not an enemy ship that would allow us to use them in this month's scenario where they would have a impact on the game.<br/><br/>Either way it would be nice to know so I can take a good list to the event on Sunday which we are both attending.</div>

Hate to bring back antimatter mine discussion, but not sure what if this might work.<br/><br/>1. Since antimatter mines being dropped on the target are an attack, could the ch'tang effect allow me to re-roll mine dice when attacking from cloaked?<br/><br/>"Ch'tang :If you initiate an attack while cloaked, you may choose any number of your attack dice and re-roll them"<br/><br/>2. If I drop mines as an attack, can I use command tokens to modify them, like the re-roll one?<br/><br/>"Re-roll symbol: you may choose any number of dice and re-roll them once. You must keep the second result."<br/><br/>3. If the dice can't be modified in any way, does the defiant effect to turn all crits into hits still apply against mines?<br/><br/>4. If I'm using an effect, like the negh'var rolling attack dice to disable a ship's shields, tractor beam to reduce defense, many of the crit effects, etc, can I use the command token re-roll on an effect like that, or must the attack effects only be used with attacks against another ship? (I don't see the harm if they can only use 1 once per round, and they chose not to use it on an attack.)<br/><br/><b>Edit</b> And now I thought of more.<br/><br/>5. Can sisko's ability to re-roll an attack or defense die once per round be used for abilities like the negh'var or crit effects?</div>

Question: While the rules state 'a die that has already been re-rolled cannot be re-rolled again during this attack unless a card effect specifically says that the die can be re-rolled more than once.'<br/><br/>Does this mean if both players have re-roll effects that only the first player to use their re-roll can do so?<br/><br/>Example:<br/>When rolling the attack dice the defender gets to modify the results first, then the attacker gets to apply their mofifications.<br/><br/>Say Sisko attacks with 4 dice and hits with all 4. He's shooting at a Klingon Ship captained by Koloth who gets to re-roll one of his opponents Attack Dice. He forces Sisko to re-roll one of the Hits and it is now a miss. It is Sisko's turn to modify the dice and he has a power that allows him to re-roll an attack dice if he wants to. Unfortunately the only 'miss' in his dice is the one that has already been re-rolled once... Does Sisko get to use his re-roll?<br/><br/>The argument in the game was whether the 'one re-roll' was 'one-reroll' total or 'one-reroll' per player... My assumption was that it was one re-roll total and that if that meant the other player couldn't use their reroll they were just out of luck - would be interested to hear other opinions though...<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Keith Mc</div>

1) In OP 1, if I beam over an away team not featuring my captain to DS9, and it's the only away team on board, can I take an action and attack this turn with DS9?<br/><br/>2) Since the station would have an effective Captain value of 1 has it missed its chance for an action or would it act next?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance</div>

Ug... I hate to ask this but after a recent play session where this was debated now I'm all confused. I can't phrase this yes/no but I can try and make it multiple choice... <br/><br/>Quantum Torpedoes say: "If a target ship is hit, add 1 (hit) result to your total damage." <br/><br/>When does this apply? I.E. a "hit" means a hit result is rolled? y/n <br/><br/>This is a cancel-able hit correct? If so would it also be changeable with other card affects... such as to a critical hit?  <br/><br/>Thus a ship hit with all hit dice (so 5 (hit) results) you would then add one die in the hit result to the mix? <br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>This all came about because my friends interpretation was basically that if any hits got through (i.e. a ship being hit = an un-cancelled hit result) it took one additional damage... which isn't the case I felt. But it got me thinking about when the torpedo's effect takes place... before or after other effects. <br/><br/>For example, if you rolled 3 blanks and 2 battle stations. Would the effect happen before you could spend a token to make those hits? Or would that step come first... then  because there is now a hit, you get the bonus? <br/><br/>I know I know... over thinking it... but in the crazy meta-game of our giant local play group, its good to know these things. </div>

If the defender avoids all hit results with dice/tokens, then the attacker doesn't inflict the extra hit.

Couple of questions I just want confirming...<br/><br/>1. If I have a target lock on a ship which is destroyed and subsequently uses cheat death. Do I keep the target lock or is it removed... what about other tokens the ship had on it when destroyed, battlestations, scans etc ?<br/><br/>2. If I start my movement in a cloaked mine range 1 area, move forward and remain in the same cloaked mine area... do I take damage again from the same mine ? I believe for anti-matter mines you have to leave the template and enter again correct ?</div>

1. Can Cloaked Minefield tokens be placed so the tokens themselves overlap? I am imagining two different players trying to place their token in the same place.<br/><br/>2. If you shoot through two or more non-planet obstacles (like Cloaked Minefield tokens) is the added defensive dice cumulative? Or is it just one additional defensive die regardless of how many non-planet obstacles you shoot through?<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>Follow-up to #1<br/><br/>3. If you cannot overlap Cloaked Minefield tokens, then which player lays down their token first?</div>

"Ships" yes.  "ENEMY Ships", I'll wait to hear from "other" Andrew. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/biggrin.gif" alt="" border="0"><br/><br/>The reason for the clarification on the specifics of the term "Enemy" is important to some of us.  OWPs may be ships, but whether they are "Opponent", "Enemy", "Friendly" (yes I am being snarky now...), should be clarified a bit further.  Some of us want to put our cloaked mines closer to the OWPs during the Month 2 tournament!  <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/wink.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

1. cloaked mines - If you are in range of multiple cloaked minefields at the start of your movement, do you trigger either of them if your single movement takes you completely out of both their fields of fire?<br/><br/>2.

Would it be worthwhile to have a separate FAQ thread that dealt specifically with the OP and related questions?  A lot of the questions include a lot of specific things to scenarios.<br/><br/>My question is also for the OP.  I see that for the debris field in OP 2 that the highest ranked player places the first token (3rd bullet point under set up).  Does this highest ranked player concept also apply towards initiative?  Is it standard initiative rules, or would the highest ranked player have initiative regardless of the build?  I could see an additional scenario - if two people each have an 100 pt Romulan fleet, would the 5-dice roll for initiative be replaced by the higher ranked player getting initiative?</div>

I suspect this has been asked before, but search functions are fail.<br/><br/>If I have two Jem'hadar attack ships, each equipped with a Long Range Tachyon Scan ("When attacking a ship at range 3, you may spend 1 [scan] token to force that ship to roll 2 less defense dice this round."), and they both attack with sensor scan tokens, is the effect of the Tachyon Scan commutative, or is it only -2 defense dice for the ship that has the upgrade?</div>

Is it possible get this "Preliminary" FAQ out of preliminary status and somewhere official like the WizKids website?  <br/><br/>Here's why I'm asking. In my OP2 event tonight there was a question about Cloaked Mines placement & the OWPs. The organizer initially ruled that the OWPs were <b>not</b> enemies or ships because nowhere on the OP2 rule sheet did it explicitly say so. I, and others, argued against that. The ruling stuck for round 1. I said if I go up against an fleet with cloaked mines I might as well concede since I built for OWPs being ships. The organizer then consulted with the 2 players with cloaked mines and changed the ruling...for rounds 2 & 3. But he insisted he couldn't get to this Preliminary FAQ for reference. One guy did lose his first round because of the initial ruling.<br/><br/>So I'd love to see something official come out ASAP, just to remove these arguments in the future.  Heck, even a link somewhere on the WizKids site pointing to the first page here would be enough for me. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

I think the issue right now is simply that there are so many expansions plus OP Kits coming out that it is difficult to get a final FAQ document at the moment. I think perhaps with November there will be a slight lull and things can be solidified.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I suggest emailing a link to the FAQ to your TD before each tournament so they are aware of the latest rulings.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

The next expansion isn't until December, but the Organized Play events are continuing past February now.

Just looking for a quick clarification on cloaked mines, I've been playing them as they stay on the board for the whole game once deployed, even after they fired as something. Is that correct? I believe it is, but it was questioned in last nights games by a player and I thought I check with the group for conformation.<br/><br/><br/>Card Text: Cloaked Mines<br/>During the planning phase, you may discard this card to place a Minefield Token within range 2 of your ship (in any direction), but not within range 2 of an enemy ship. If an enemy ship passes within range 1 of the token, roll 3 attack dice (-1 if the target ship immediately performs a [scan] action). Any [hit] or [crit] damages the target ship as normal. The affected ship does not roll any defense dice.  </div>

That's a bit warped.  Like you said, you can just make a 100pt survival/turtle fleet and hope for a win through time out.<br/><br/>Though I don't see anything in any thread that states that a ruling has been made that agrees this is the intent.<br/><br/>I would think it is a dice off at the end if no one lost anything on either side.</div>

If we had every little thing in the FAQ there would be so much to read.<br/><br/>All you really have to say to them is critical damage is still damage, so it works.  <br/><br/>It actually is in the rulebook on page 17:<br/><br/>"CRITICAL DAMAGE<br/><br/>When a ship suffers damage, players deal the Damage Card face down and ignore the card's text.  However, when a ship suffers critical damage, players deal the Damage Card face up.<br/><br/>The text on face up Damage Cards is resolved as instructed on the card.  When a ship is dealt a Damage Card face up, place a Critical Hit Token near the ship.  This token reminds players that this ship is affected by an ongoing effect.  If a ship somehow manages to remove the ongoing effect (e.g. by flipping the card face down, by discarding that card, etc.) return the Critical Hit Token to the supply."<br/><br/>Both are forms of damage.  Now if a card said it can remove something more specific, like a face down damage card or face up damage card, then there would be a restriction.  </div>

Question came up tonight in RE: a crit result for 'stunned helmsmen'.  It reads:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>The next time you attack, do not roll any attack dice.  Then flip this card face down.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>A few questions came up from that:<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k1.png" alt="1" border="0"> Do I have to have a target for an attack?  As it happens, I got this crit on a turn I was quite facing away from the enemy, and slowly looping around.  Can I just "attack" empty space on the following turn?  Fire a salvo into the void, then flip the card over?<br/><br/><img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/k2.png" alt="2" border="0"> This was during the OP2 event, and as it happens there WAS one of the OWPs directly in front of the ship in question on the first turn after the crit.  Now, the rules say these cannot be DESTROYED in OP2...<br/><br/>"For purposes of this tournament, disregard the Hull and Shield values as well as the SP Cost. The OWPs are not controlled by either player and may not be destroyed."<br/><br/>...however, they are definitely counted as an 'enemy ship'.  Could I *attack* that OWP?

If you moved out of the damage area the next turn, you would not roll damage.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Can we get this promoted to the first post in the thread please? There's been some confusion around here about if the Range 1 of Cloaked Mines behaves like Antimatter Mines and obstacles for damage when starting inside the area.</div>

1. When using Cheat Death with Suicide Attack, would a brand new ship doing the attack be left with Max Damage - 1, or be still brand new?  As Suicide Attack mentions destroying the ship, but not dealing damage to it, it would usually just be removed from play, but does it actually receive damage cards until enough to explode?<br/><br/><b>Cheat Death</b>: If your ship was just destroyed, discard this card to remove Damage Cards one at a time from your Ship Card until the amount of damage is 1 point less than your Hull Value. Flip all remaining Damage Cards face down.<br/><b>Suicide Attack</b>: ACTION: At the end of the Activation Phase, you must make a 1 Forward Maneuver and place an Auxiliary Power Token beside your ship.  If your ship overlaps an enemy ship, destroy your ship and roll 8 attack dice to damage the enemy ship.  That ship rolls defense dice against this attack.  This Upgrade may only be purchased for a Jem'Hadar ship.<br/><br/>2. Do Cloaked Mines attack after a ship movement and before its action, or after its action?  Since the ship can do its Scan action to reduce damage, you could argue that it would need to do all actions prior to the attack.  This has an impact in OP3 where one of the actions is lowering the shields to beam troops down.<br/><br/><b>Cloaked Mines</b> relevant text: If an enemy ship passes within Range 1 of the token, roll 3 attack dice (-1 if the target ship immediately performs a [SCAN] action.<br/><br/></div>

A question I came up with while planning out my build for my second month two OP build:<br/><br/>If a ship has used Once More Unto the Breach, are they allowed to forsake one of their attacks for Barrage of Fire (at the -1 penalty from Once More, of course) and use the other to attack with (again, at the -1 penalty)?<br/><br/>Barrage of Fire: Attack:  Discard this card to perform this attack.  Target a friendly ship within range 1 of your ship.  Target ship may not make an attack this round.  Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack.  Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs.  Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside both ships. <br/><br/>Once More Unto the Breach: Action: Discard this card to allow your primary weapon to make two attacks this turn at -1 attack die each.  You may not roll Defense dice this turn.</div>

Andrew, could you put the ruling that the skill 8 Martok does not lose his ability to give a free action when he himself bumps a ship or goes through an obstacle into the actual FAQ?<br/><br/>I refer to page 23 of the FAQ thread where you say:<br/> <br/><i>Card text is unaffected when moving into an obstacle. You simply cannot perform Actions. Since Martok's text is not an Action, he may still use his text in this situation.<br/><br/>Andrew</i> <br/><br/>Here are questions that can be inserted into the FAQ to clarify:<br/><br/><b>Does the skill 8 Martok lose his ability to grant a free action to a friendly ship if his own ship...<br/>a)...bumps or overlaps another ship?<br/>b)...goes through or overlaps an obstacle?<br/>c)...performs a red maneuver such as a Come About?<br/></b><br/><br/>Also, <br/><b><br/>If a ship is denied its action by an auxiliary power token, collision with an obstacle or another ship, or the like, can skill 8 Martok still give that ship a free action? <br/></b><br/>Please clarify this in the FAQ ASAP as this comes up quite a bit in my games and though I have printed out your post from page 23 of this thread, put it in my binder, and will show it to opponents, some people prefer to see it in the actual FAQ.<br/><br/>Thanks very, very much. </div>

Perfect. I know this is in the rules but I had an inquiry about it in the last game I played!<br/><br/>He was giving out free actions with Martok to ships that had to skip preform actions steps and also cloaking when he had no active shields! Yikes!<br/><br/>Drew</div>

Hi Andrew,<br/><br/>This question came up again at our tournament regarding concussive charges.

Do locked or converted dice count towards the one re-roll limit?  Por example<br/><br/>1)  If I use Command Token to lock one of my Attack Die as a Critical, can Koloth force me to re-roll it?<br/><br/>2)  If Koloth forces me to re-roll an attack die and it comes up a Hit, can Toreth convert that hit to a Critical (assuming no other candidates for conversion are available)?</div>

I'll defer to Andrew but I believe that the defender's modifiers are applied to the dice rolled first, then the attacker's modifiers.<br/><br/>In the examples you gave, I'm unsure of the Command Token effect and how it interacts in this instance, but I'm fairly certain Toreth would convert that hit to a critical.</div>

Hi Andrew,<br/>I have a question regarding the special ability of the Kraxon vs. the shield-penetrating crits of Missile Launchers. Relevant card text:<br/><br/>Missile Launchers (Ferengi/ LE Krayton Pack)<br/>Any [CRITICAL] results that would damage an opponent's Shields inflict critical damage to that ship's Hull instead.<br/><br/>Kraxon<br/>Whenever a friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship receives damage you may transfer any amount of that damage to your own Shields, if possible.<br/><br/>I use Missile Launchers to attack a ship friendly to the Kraxon, rolling a crit. If the Kraxon chooses to absorb the damage does it take a crit damage directly to its hull per the Missile Launcher text, or does it take the damage to its shields per its own text?<br/><br/>Thanks for your commitment to the community here, it's much appreciated!</div>

Quick clarification needed on the Barrage of Fire card.<br/><br/>Barrage of Fire: Attack:  Discard this card to perform this attack.  Target a friendly ship within range 1 of your ship.  Target ship may not make an attack this round.  Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack.  Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs.  Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside both ships. <br/><br/>In the event that the ship that is joining the attack has had its primary weapon value reduced by a critical hit, for example, I think you should use the reduced value, not the printed value, of its primary weapon. Is that correct?<br/><br/>Thanks again Andrew for all your hard work on this. The kids and I are absolutely loving this game. We've tried and played a lot of war, miniature and board games, and this is one of the few that has gotten all of us (15 year old daughter, 12 year old son, and myself) hooked.

So "1 Forward" includes all forward options that move 1: Straight, Bank, and Turn (if there's ever a ship than can perform a 1 Turn). In fact, on page 10 of the rule book, it singles out Straight Maneuver as being different than forward or back in the "Full Astern" example.<br/><br/>Dax just clearly eliminates the Turn option.<br/><br/>And this is why I ask in the FAQ. (This is also why wording consistency matters a lot. Think of all the "this round" arguments that could have been avoided if +1 die effects had been consistently worded.)</strike><br/><br/>Nevermind. The spreadsheet doesn't have the correct wording. The Squad Builder app says "1 Forward Maneuver". Until I can get back to my actual cards I'm pretty sure that's correct. </div>

Command Tokens and the Romulan Pilot both say to "place a Scan token beside the ship as a free action." Does this wording difference mean that it is different to the Scan action and could potentially result in multiple scan tokens beside a ship and/or multiple Romulan Pilot activations in a turn?<br/><br/>Second question if you can have multiple scan tokens:<br/>Can you spend multiple scan tokens to Long-Range Tachyon scan for -2 defense dice each?</div>

I just wanted to confirm something in OP3. We ruled that if a cloaked ship gave up it's attack to have ground troops battle on AR-558 that it does not lose it's cloak. Under the same logic as the ground troops not getting ship buffs, since the ship is not involved in combat. </div>

With OP3 happening this month and the Battle Points special rule being in effect, I have a question about how to run my OP3 tournament. <br/><br/>The special rule says that if you control the planet at the end of the battle and you won the round, you get an extra Battle Point. So let us look at this scenario and tell me who wins my hypothetical tournament. (Fleet points are irrelevant here)<br/><br/>Player A goes 3-0 but never controlled the planet at the end of any round. He therefore has 7 Battle Points (6 for 3 round wins and 1 for participating)<br/><br/>Player B goes 2-1 but controlled the planet in all 3 rounds he played in. He therefore has 8 Battle Points (4 for his 2 wins, 1 for his loss and 1 for participating and 2 for controlling the planet in his 2 wins).<br/><br/>So, does an undefeated player really lose to someone that lost a round because of this special rule? That seems like a really bad rule if that is what is supposed to occur. <br/><br/>And I'm sure some of you will ask how likely that is to happen. We have had 10 and 11 participants the first 2 months and expect 12 this time with people likely to be turned away due to space and map element limitations, so it is really likely that at least one of our 2-1 players could have more points than the two players that go 3-0. <br/><br/>Also, will the Wizkids tournament software that we use be modified to accommodate this, or do I have to run the tournament on paper because Battle Points are supposed to rank players and not just wins.<br/><br/>Thanks Andrew.<br/></div>

Can the Defiant still get critical hits from normal rerolls? For example, the attacker rolls 4 dice and rolls a hit, a critical and 2 misses. Does the Defiant apply its text before the attacker rerolls by using a target lock or after the reroll? If it is before then the attacker has 2 hits and could roll 2 criticals that are applied to the ship. Or if it is after then the attacker would have 4 hits (3 converted from criticals). Thanks</div>

Andrew, on the Command Tokens it uses the wording:<br/><i><br/>"When a Command Token is used, it is flipped over and may not be used again in that Battle."</i><br/><br/> ... but it never says what side it starts on.<br/><br/>The picture on the card is the back of the token, so I'm thinking the initial 5 are placed "face down" and when you use them, you flip them over to reveal what you're using.<br/><br/>Was this the intent? <br/><br/></div>

This is another one of those examples where precarious wording causes confusion. Part of me can't help but believe the the true idea of the card was to reduce a ships defense roll by two for a round which would make this an effective anti cloaking upgrade. Despite the fact that there has been a lot of discussion in regards to the "this round" text I just don't SE the point of it otherwise. It's an upgrade you have to discard to use and to do that to take two defense dice away total makes it seem so unworth it. If it did affect the ship for the round however cause a minus two defense die each time defense is rolled that shooting phase, thereby allowing the rest of your fleet to take advantage of it together it seems far more logical and useful especially considering the cost plus the one time use. I'd love to hear if that was truly the intention of the card.</div>

In a recent OP event two of my ships ended up being forced into range of the same Cloaked Mine token (the other option was the fly off the board). My opponent quoted a rule that a particular set of mines only go off on the first ship to trigger them in a given round. I didn't see much reason to argue as it avoided a shot against one of my ships, and everyone there seemed to agree this was the way it was played... I can't however find any rules to that effect anywhere... am I looking in the wrong places? Should I consult the Anti-Matter mine rules? <br/><br/>(PS: I lost anyway, so even if his interpretation of the rules was wrong, it didn't hurt him too much in the end). </div>

Andrew, would you please consider adding these to the FAQ?  <br/><br/>1. Can you beam tribbles to a planet?<br/><br/>2. Worf (either Federation version) does not count as a Klingon for tribbles, right?<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure #2 came up here already, but I can't find the answer after searching.<br/><br/>Thanks.</div>

Quick question:<br/><br/>1. Geordi's card says "If your ship has a [SCAN] Token beside it, you may force one ship you attacked this round to re-roll one defense die of your choice." <br/><br/>So, if I understand the rules correctly, you could 'save' his ability for another ship to take advantage of later in the round, correct?</div>

Geordi's card says "If your ship has a [SCAN] Token beside it, you may force one ship you attacked this round to re-roll one defense die of your choice." <br/><br/>So, if I understand the rules correctly, you could 'save' his ability for another ship to take advantage of later in the round, correct?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Correct.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Hi Andrew,<br/><br/>I am confused by this. The very first FAQ answer reads:<br/><br/><b>1. If I have a Ship, Captain, Upgrade, or Damage Card that uses the word "you", does it refer to that specific ship or to all of your ships?<br/>As mentioned on page 21 of the Full Rules (under "Card Abilities"), abilities on Ship Cards, Captain Cards, Upgrade Cards, and Damage Cards only affect the ship to which they are assigned, unless otherwise specified.</b><br/><br/>Based on the above, the phrase "<b>one ship you attacked</b>" in Data's text would refer to the attack by the ship he is on, and not carry over to an attack by another ship. Am I missing something?<br/><br/>Thanks!</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>This is perfectly consistent with the use of "you" and "your". What the card is saying is that when Geordi's ship attacks another, that defending ship is now "marked" to reroll a defensive die sometime this round, at the attacker's discretion. So if another ship on Geordi's team attacks THAT SAME TARGET, you can reroll a defensive die. <br/><br/>It's a perfect reading of that card, which I admit I had not considered.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>This is actually just a case of unclear wording on our part. Geordi's text works on a ship that his ship is attacking. So it works right away. The word "attacked" should just say "attack."<br/><br/>Sorry for the confusion,<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Okay so I admit I've started playing both Attack wing and X-wing at the same time! while the rules are similar, there are some that are different.<br/><br/>My question for you Andrew, is the case of Obstacles. I see in X-Wing if you are on an object you cannot fire during combat, I'm I correct in that in Attack Wing you can???<br/><br/>Second question about obstacles, with the ones from month 1 or 2 that are not just circles, can we use those for obstacles and how many should we use in tournament games??<br/><br/>Danke</div>

Question about EM Pulse (Krayton Version):<br/><br/>Assuming I have an EM Pulse on a low-initiative ship, if I move and use my action to EM pulse another ship before it performs its maneuver.  <br/><br/>Then later during the activation phase it the player reveals they had already selected a red manuever during the planning phase before recieving the token, I get to pick their maneuver as per the normal rules for taking a red maneuver under aux power, including one that takes them out of the play area and destroying their ship, correct?<br/><br/>It all seems perfectly legal, but pretty situationally potent.</div>

Thank you very much for your answer earlier!!  I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my question and all the others here =D<br/>I have one more for you -<br/>Can you use the enterprise d's 360 attack (which has been ruled to be a primary attack if I remember right) to fire attacks with "barrage of fire" or other 'replace primary attack with x' effects?

Romulan pilot: after you move you may discard this card to place a [scan] token beside your ship as a free action.

You must re-roll all of your dice and keep the results of the second roll."<br/><br/>Does "keep the results" mean you cannot convert the re-rolled results?

How does this pair with Counter Attack? Counter Attack says if your ship is damaged, "you may immediately make 1 free attack against that ship."

I have a somewhat unique question Andrew,<br/><br/><br/>Yesterday my friends and I were playing, as we came across some trouble.<br/><br/>He had received the critical damage card "The next time you roll attack dice, do not roll. Then flip this card face down."<br/><br/>Here's the conundrum, his entire fleet was build around the Anti-Matter Mines.<br/><br/>So would he place the mines? and not roll any dice? Or would he TRY to place the mines, but be stopped? (As the mines are an 'Attack: Discard this card to...' )<br/><br/>We also had our OP organizer tell us we couldn't target lock through the planet. I know in X-Wing Miniatures, sight is not needed to target lock as long as the enemy is within range 1-3. I couldn't find anything in the rules to say it doesn't work just like that in Star Trek Attack Wing!<br/><br/>Drew</div>

Declare in your action phase "this is picard's action" and "this is my ship action" mainly due to the fact that people may be seeing you as trying to pull a "fast one."  When you receive free actions the rules don't specify in what order they have to be taken, so be sure to declare them in the order you want/need.</div>

We worked the points into the total to determine who one... actually in one game one player lost a 17pt ship but had 9 tokens on planet so actually one that game by 1 point and controlled the planet too.</div>

Andrew, I have a question about the Reinforcements Sideboard.  If you bring in something from the sideboard, can you use their text as soon as they come into play?<br/><br/>For example - Martok.  (After you move, choose 1 friendly ship within range 1-2 whose Captain has a lower skill than Martok's.  The chosen ship may immediately perform one free action.)<br/><br/>Say I have a ship that moves and then performs its action (bring Martok from the sideboard).  Can Martok now give a free action to a friendly ship within range?<br/><br/>Same with Mirok.  If you performed a green maneuver and bring in Mirok, can you repair?<br/><br/>Thanks!</div>

I have a question regarding the sideboard for OP3, and the points system. According to the sideboard, you pay a 10-point cost for the use of the sideboard, and as I read it, you get to assign 20 points worth of cards to the sideboard. My questions are as follows:<br/><br/>1- Assuming there is a 100-point build limit, let's say the player in question pays the 10-points for the sideboard. Does the 20 points assigned to the board apply to the build limit, effectively making the card cost 30 points? Or do the 20 points not cost against the build limit, effectively giving the player a 120-point build in a 100-point limit?<br/><br/>2- How does this affect the scoring in the OP events, because as I understand it, you get points as follows: 100 minus the points left on your opponents' build; this could effectively give someone a 30-point buffer to drive opponents' scores down if you place cards and keep them in the sideboard. <br/><br/>3- how do one-use cards (such as mines, or certain crew cards) affect the above situations?<br/><br/>I'm just concerned both from a balance standpoint; someone having access to 20 extra points worth of gear seems a bit much. Even if you do have to spend an action to swap gear, you'd have a very versatile build. Thanks for the time!</div>

If you use the sideboard in a 100 point build, you build your ships to 90 add the 10 for the sideboard and put up to 20 on the sideboard.  This gives you 110 points worth of options for the cost of 100.<br/><br/>Also, since your build sheet only has the sideboard listed as a 10 point resource, you still start at 100 and deduct from there.  The 20 on the sideboard don't count towards the build....just the sideboard.<br/><br/>That's how me and my friends have interpreted it.</div>

(That is, it doesn't say "also, the winning player adds..." just "a player adds...")<br/><br/>Indeed, it would even seem to imply that if BOTH players did have ground combat tokens on the planet, BOTH of them would actually get the fleet points for having tokens remaining.  (Although obviously, in that case, neither would quality for the battle point bonus - and that these two things are listed distinctly, and have different and partially contradictory qualifications for them, makes me think they really are two unrelated bonuses)</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>We played it that the additional Fleet Points for remaining troops were independent of who won the battle. (And since Fleet Points <i>determine</i> the winner of a particular battle, I figure they should be added.)</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>My understanding is that this is correct. In a tie, Fleet Points determine the winner, and since Fleet Points for occupying the planet are given to both players (i.e. you don't need to win the battle to get those bonus Fleet Points), then planetary occupation could determine the winner if neither side destroys the other.<br/><br/>But as always, I am not an expert on the Tournament Rules, so I reserve the right to reverse this later. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

Andrew, I have a question about the Reinforcements Sideboard. If you bring in something from the sideboard, can you use their text as soon as they come into play?<br/><br/>For example - Martok. (After you move, choose 1 friendly ship within range 1-2 whose Captain has a lower skill than Martok's. The chosen ship may immediately perform one free action.)<br/><br/>Say I have a ship that moves and then performs its action (bring Martok from the sideboard). Can Martok now give a free action to a friendly ship within range?<br/><br/>Same with Mirok. If you performed a green maneuver and bring in Mirok, can you repair?<br/><br/>Thanks!</div>

Timing of cloaked mine damage question.

If an enemy ship passes within range 1 of the token, roll 3 attack dice (-1 if the target ship immediately performs a [SCAN] Action). Any [HIT] or [CRITICAL] damages the target ship as normal. The affected ship does not roll any defense dice. <br/><br/>1. An undamaged ship captained by Mirok ends its movement within range 1 of enemy's cloaked mine, and is with in range 1 of a friendly ship. Does Mirok ability trigger before or after dice are rolled for the mines and any damage is applied? <i>We went with mine field then Mirok when this happened, but is was less clear to me if that was the right ruling</i><br/><br/>2. An undamaged ship captained by Mirok movement template crosses into range range 1 of enemy's cloaked mine but the ship does not end in the field, and is with in range 1 of a friendly ship at its end point. Does Mirok ability trigger before or after dice are rolled for the mines and any damage is applied? <i>This didn't come up but I would think it's more clear in this case that the damage comes during the move, so you would roll it before placing the ship in its end position so Mirok would trigger after any mine damage was applied</i></div>

Found it. Sorry I re-asked asked a answered question. However this might want to be FAQ on the front page as personally I wasn't reading the cloak mines like that at all, and it matters a lot that you get an action before mines attack you. <br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Andrew Parks wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><br/>Cloaked Mines inflict their damage after the ship completes its Perform Action step.<br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Follow up, is the timing of hitting/crossing an in play (i.e. not a attack from) anti-matter minefield token the same? <br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

Question on the Interphase Generator (not the one asked in the initial FAQ!).  Card reads:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Interphase Generator - When defending while you are Cloaked, you may discard this card after all the dice have been rolled to reduce the damage from a single attack to exactly 1 [DAMAGE].</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Question is - what is "while you are cloaked"?  Specifically as a result of the logic around when you can 'sensor echo'.  IE., you cannot 'sensor echo' on the turn you ENGAGE the cloak as an action, as you are not "cloaked" then, but "cloak<i>ing</i>" - the specific text in question being:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>A ship can only perform a Sensor Echo Action if it is <i>currently Cloaked</i> (e.g. from a previous turn)</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>(emphasis mine)<br/><br/>That makes it sound like the turn you take the 'cloak' action, you are not yet 'fully cloaked' (cannot 'sensor echo', CAN be target locked, etc).<br/><br/>Does this logic apply to 'interphase generator', as well?  IE., you cannot use it on the turn you take the 'cloak' action, but only on following turns?</div>

I couldn't find a clarification on this: if both players are using cloaked mines during the same planning phase, is there an order in which they should be deployed?<br/><br/>Insofar as it is tactically significant, it seems that there should be, but I'm not sure that there is. The cards don't provide an answer, and there is no order in place for the planning phase.<br/><br/>This came up in a game recently in which an opponent played two cloaked mines, and then I played cloaked mines. He wanted to pick his up and replace them, but we just went ahead with the game since neither or us was sure about whether or not there's an order to be followed.<br/><br/>Naturally, where I placed my mines was in part due to where he had previously placed his mines, because it's a clue as to what his strategy might be. By the same token, once mine were placed, he wanted to use that information in placing his mines.<br/><br/>...and frankly, if it becomes an issue among the players at the venue, it's easier to smooth feathers if I just say, "Andrew Parks said..."<br/><br/>(After all, the Cloaked Mines are becoming VERY popular, so this is likely going to come up again.)</div>

Yes - that didn't take into account the cost of the Sideboard.<br/><br/>But - conversely - a person who had a 40 SP Enterprise-D that swapped out Upgrades/Captains to bring its value down to 28 would only grant an opponent 28 points instead of its original 40 point value.<br/><br/>Having the original ship value from the fleet list be the scoring value makes everything much simpler <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

Similar to Resources, you would score the SP of the Admiral's Orders if you eliminated the opponent's fleet. <br/><br/>For United Force, the extra 10 points worth of Upgrades should be marked on the Fleet sheet with an asterisk and not counted against the opponent's Fleet at the end of the match. This is similar to the cards that negin on the Reinforcements Sideboard.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

Also, remember that the Sideboard doesn't allow you to simply banish a card from a ship at will. You must exchange the card for one that is on the sideboard.<br/><br/>Now if you are able later to re-play an Upgrade from the Sideboard (that was originally in play on a ship) then that would be a nice advantage of the Sideboard and one that is in keeping with the spirit of this Resource (i.e. allowing Upgrades to retreat and return to battle).</div>

You must exchange the card for one that is on the sideboard.<br/><br/>Now if you are able later to re-play an Upgrade from the Sideboard (that was originally in play on a ship) then that would be a nice advantage of the Sideboard and one that is in keeping with the spirit of this Resource (i.e. allowing Upgrades to retreat and return to battle).</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Let's start with this:<br/><br/>I.R.W. Khazara (Romulan 30)<br/>Jean-Luc Picard (Federation 7)<br/>Plasma Torpedoes (Romulan 5)<br/>Tactical Officer (Romulan 3)<br/>All Forward Disruptor Banks (Romulan 4)<br/>49 points<br/><br/>Romulan D'deridex (Romulan 28)<br/>Donatra (Romulan 4)<br/>Advanced Weapon System (Klingon 6)<br/>Tactical Officer (Romulan 3)<br/>41 points<br/><br/>Resources: Reinforcement Sideboard (10)<br/>-Polarized Hull Plating (Romulan 2)<br/>-other junk that doesn't matter for this example <br/><br/>Total Point Cost: 100<br/><br/>So the 41 pt D'deridex  swaps out the 6 pt Klingon AWS for a 2 pt Romulan Polarized Hull Plating. The D'deridex gets destroyed & my opponent gets 37 pts instead of 41 pts. The next turn I put the AWS on my IRW Khazara which didn't have anything in it's Tech Slot. The Khazara started at 49 pts but is now worth 56 pts and doesn't die.<br/><br/>I've just "cheated" my opponent out of 4 points. With the right setup (I threw this example together in less than 5 minutes), it could be very easy to deny 10 or more points from the enemy if I don't lose my entire fleet.<br/><br/>The math would be far, far simpler if a destroyed ship is worth the points it started with, although that would encourage the "start with a bare ship & spend several turns equipping it from the Sideboard" tactic.</div>

Andrew,<br/><br/>Just wanted to get a little clarification in Barrage of Fire. I looked through the thread searching for this and wasn't able to find the answer. <br/><br/>In the FAQ you say a ship that had participated in a BoF before can't be used again that round, but you said in an example with the Kraxon you say it's okay that it will just have two Aux Power Tokens. <br/><br/>The FAQ says the Primamry Weapon Value PRINTED, so Donatra wouldn't help on the ship assisting, but would Donatra still help the ship that is using BoF not the one assisting? <br/><br/>Thanks. </div>

Back to the sideboard and Victory points, I think this should work:<br/><br/>If you totally destroy your opponents fleet 100 Pts.<br/><br/>If you don't Victory points would be worked out as follows:<br/><br/>(Build cost of Starting Fleet + Value of Cards on Sideboard at Start)<br/><br/>LESS<br/><br/>(Build cost of Surviving Ships + Value of Cards on Sideboard at End)<br/><br/>Cards which are discarded on use are put under the ship that they were on when used in the usual way.<br/><br/>Consider the extremes: <br/><br/>1)<br/><br/>A person placing nothing on his ships and a full 20 points on the sideboard to try get the maximum points possible (they have one generic captain to trade out)and has an initial build of 99 (36, 34 and 29).<br/><br/>Assume they put everything on their ships 15 points on the first, 5 on the second and nothing on the third. (51, 39 and 29).<br/><br/>They win but their opponent destroys the first and third ships. They have 0 points on the sideboard at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Opponent's VP's : (99 + 20) - (39+0) = 80 the cost of the ships destroyed.<br/><br/>2)<br/><br/>A the person that tools up 2 ships but places cheap upgrades on the sideboard to try trade out expensive upgrades just before their ships are destroyed to reduce the points killed.<br/><br/>Assume 2 ships worth 49 and 41 at the start with a sideboard with 8 points on it (a single Generic Captain, Klag, Nuclear Missiles, Polarised Hull Plating, Conditional Surrender).<br/><br/>During the game he trades out the item's on the 49 point ship just before it is destroyed. He removes Khan, Spock, Antimatter Mines Cochrane Maneuver and EM Pulse and replaces them with the cards from the sideboard. <br/><br/>NB: You should only count the face value of cards which started on the sideboard while cards transferred to the sideboard on them should be valued including any cross faction penalties. You should be able to work these out from the original lists.<br/><br/>In this case the ship that started off at 49 is destroyed after the cards have been swapped.<br/><br/>Opponent's VP's: (100+8) - (40+25) = 43 points<br/><br/>Not as high as the original 49 points for the ship (understandable as they have played at least one turn without the full abilities of the more expensive upgrades given up but more than the 32 points spent on the cards that ended up on the destroyed ship.<br/><br/>I think this is the best compromise to minimise abuse of the reinforcement resource in either of the 2 possible ways.<br/><br/>Might be a little complicated for on the day though.<br/><br/><br/></div>

1) Using Command Tokens, can player us the Battlestations token and as a free action place a Battlestations token next to a ship, <b>without</b> the Battlestations action on the ship's action bar? Many non-Federation ships do not have Battlestations as an available action. For example: Could a Vor’Cha class Klingon ship be given a Battlestations token using the Command Tokens?<br/><br/>2) These series of questions deal with mines, either Cloaked Mines or Antimatter Mines. In all cases, assume that the minefield has been deployed by player A. In all cases, the question is: What happens to the deployed mines?<br/><br/>2a) What happens if the ship which has the mine upgrade card is destroyed? What happens to the deployed mines? Are they destroyed?<br/><br/>2b) What happens if the upgrade card is <b>disabled</b> by the opposing player B? What happens to the deployed mines? Are they destroyed?<br/><br/>2c) What happens if the upgrade card is <b>discarded</b> by an action by opposing player B, such as Klingon’s Sabotage Elite Talent? What happens to the deployed mines? Are they destroyed?<br/><br/>2d) What happens if the upgrade card is <b>stolen</b> by an action by opposing player B, specifically using the Superior Intellect Elite Talent. What happens to the deployed mines? And perhaps just as relevant, who now owns the deployed minefield?<br/><br/>Thanks in advance. And my apologies if the first question has already been answered, as I couldn't find it in this thread.</div>

1)Yes a ship without the Battlestations action on it's Action Bar can be given Battlestations by using a command token.<br/><br/>2a) Once deployed the mine tokens remain in play for the rest of the game regardless of whether the ship is destroyed or not. <br/><br/>2b, 2c and 2d - When the mines are deployed the mine upgrade card is discarded and so is no longer on the ship for an opponent to disable/discard/steal. So these situations can't happen.<br/><br/>Hope this helps.</div>

When using the Antimatter Mines, I understand that the token must be placed at least partially in range 1 so it can extend beyond range 1, but what about arc?  If I want to place it very close to the ship, can it extend outside the arc?<br/><br/>For abilities like Miles O'Brien from the starter set that allows you to disable an upgrade at range 1 - 3, does that work through obstacles, in particular if there is a planet as the obstacle?<br/><br/>If you fire Antimatter Mines from the Reliant, does the +1 apply within range 1, but not if it hits something with the part of the token that is at range 2?</div>

Hi, I want to make sure I'm reading this correctly, please.  <br/><br/>A Captain with greater skill moves after but attacks before a Captain with lesser skill.<br/><br/>However, with two Captains being equally skilled, the ship with <i>initiative</i> (as defined on p.18 and p.21) MOVES before *and* ATTACKS before.<br/><br/>Correct?  And if so, why the difference?<br/><br/></div>

And I think it's a pretty sensible thing to do.  I'd let your TO know about it.<br/><br/>As Dave correctly points out, however, proxied cloak mine TOKENS are explicitly allowed, since they for whatever reason neglected to include the required token to play the mines in the expansion.  But yeah I think if you want to cheese cloaked mines you should be made to pay the 15 bucks a pop to do it.</div>

There is no proxy rule, but I enforce the following rules at my venue:<br/><br/>1. no proxied cards or manuver dials<br/><br/>2. the official print and play token for mines is (of course) allowed provided you also have the upgrade cards<br/><br/>3. ships may be proxied or modified for aesthetic purposes (e.g. people paint their ships, substitute the MicroMachines Enterprise for the "Mini"prise, etc) so long as the modified ship is recognizable as the faction/model in question and on the STAW base</div>

Hi Andrew,<br/>My question is on INVASION PLANS:<br/><br/>"When you initiate an attack against a ship at range 2-3 while you are cloaked, you may discard this card to force that ship to roll 2 less defense dice against your attack."<br/><br/>Do I have to declare that I am using this before I roll my attack dice, or can I declare it after my roll but before the defender's roll?<br/><br/>Thanks</div>

Is there a particular order in which effects are added or subtracted?  If I use something that causes a ship to roll 2 less defense dice for a turn, but the ship starts off with an evasion of 1, does the card still get to reduce it by 2 if the target is at range 3?</div>

If you get an additional action from something like Picard or Martok (Negh'var), can I perform an action twice? For example, Gowron as a normal action and again from Martok's extra action when Martok moves closer to Gowron. Or, evade as a normal and 2nd evade from Picard or Martok.</div>

So, when the defending ship goes to take their defense dice, they start at 1, and would add 1 for range, and subtract 2 for the Long Range Tachyon Scan. Or they could do it in any other order.<br/><br/>In the end, the defending ship has 0 defense dice, in this situation.</div>

Sorry, another Barrage of Fire question<br/><br/>How does Barrage of Fire work in work in conjunction with re-rolling cards, battle stations, scans, etc.?<br/><br/>Example 1: Ship A (IKS CH'TANG) has barrage of Fire and and fires while cloaked with Ship B. This allows the CH'Tang to re-roll any number of your attack dice? Is this just Ship A's dice, both sets of dice or none of the dice?<br/><br/>Example 1B: Same example, but ship B is the cloaked ship with the re-roll feature?<br/><br/>Example 2: Ship A has barrage of fire and a battle stations (using defense condition 1) token next to it. Ship B does not have a battle station next to it. Do you get to change all of the battle station rolls to hits, just those from ship A, or none?<br/><br/>Many more example of this are possible and could be key in developing my strategy. Please help determine proper rules. I want to play fairly!<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Mourz</div>

Question came up in a match, tonight.<br/><br/>The Stasis Field Generator reads:<br/><br/>"If your ship is not cloaked, disable all of your remaining shields and discard this Upgrade to target a ship at Range 1-2.  That ship must disable all of its remaining ships and cannot attack this round.  Your ship rolls 2 less attack dice this round."<br/><br/>A person had placed this upgrade on the IRW Praetus...which has no shields to disable.<br/><br/>The best interpretation we could figure on that was the cloaking rules, which used identical wording:<br/><br/>"When performing a Cloak action, disable all the ship's remaining shields by flipping them over to their red side (see "Disabling Shields" on page 19) and place a [cloak] token on the ship with its green side up."<br/><br/>And, of course, we know you have to have SOME shields in order to cloak - if you have no shields, then you have no shields 'to disable' and cannot cloak.<br/><br/>Given similarity of wording ("disable all the ship's remaining shields"), it was ruled that the projected stasis field could not be operated by a ship that did not have any shields.<br/><br/>Was this a correct ruling?</div>

If a specific shield requirement is given, you must be able to disable that many shields to use the effect.<br/><br/>I think of the difference as follows: Scotty requires you to "spend" 2 active shields to gain the attack dice - it's a cost of using the ability. If you don't have 2 active shields available, Scotty can't re-route their power to the weapons, or whatever. Abilities like the Stasis Field simply want all of your shields to be down at the end of the effect, hence "all remaining shields". It's confusing that they used the same "all remaining" wording for cloak, but as Andrew said, it has a specifically listed additional requirement in the rulebook.</div>

Scotty can repair shields.  So after he repairs 2, then use the attack dice power.  But that's like three rounds of actions. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/tongue.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

Month 3 OP3, <br/><br/>Earlier in the FAQ I thought I saw that if a cloaked ship were to forgo its attack to let the ground troops fire, it wouldn't decloack, now I don't see that entry any longer but it's in the thread.<br/><br/>Was that changed or am I just seeing things?<br/><br/></div>

Corby, your tone is not helpful nor are your answers accurate.<br/><br/>1. The <b>printer friendly link shows posts up until Nov 8</b> but not beyond that date.  Therefore not all posts are available by this method<br/><br/>2. Did I suggest a move to a less "useful" or "user friendly" site?  No I didn't.<br/><br/>3. Searching only works on posts that appear<br/><br/>4. That's ok, but not everyone is playing the OP events.  Just a suggestion.</div>

Sorry if this is a pain, but I'd like to please revisit this Romulan Pilot and clarify that <b>a Romulan Pilot <i>should</i> be able to take a free action 'after you move' a red maneuver <i>this turn</i></b>.  <br/><br/>Reasoning:<br/><br/>1. We've established in other posts that during the 6 steps of activation "after you move" is after step 3. (e.g. 'after you move' with Martok vs. Picard 'as a free action').<br/><br/>2. Therefore the Romulan pilot's 'after you move' ability happens after step 3 and before step 4 - Check for Power Strain.  <br/><br/>3. After step 3 but before step 4, no Auxiliary Power token yet exists from a Red Maneuver <i>this turn</i>.  If this is incorrect, please stop reading now and show me where is this FAQ'd or in the rules.<br/><br/>3. So therefore you <i>can</i> take a free action if you have no Auxiliary Power 'after you move'.  In the Pilot's case, this places a Scan token and immediately we re-execute steps 1-3.  <br/><br/>4. Once both moves are done, we then proceed to step 4, where the phrase "just executed" is murky for me.  Both a red and then a green were "just executed", but the Red Maneuver text is listed first in the paragraph.  Therefore I'd reason an Auxiliary Power token is first placed and then immediately removed - all in step 4.  <br/><br/>Proceed to step 5 and 6, and the ship may take an action.<br/><br/><b>Is this correct? </b>  Thank you so much for your patience and dedication to this game.

I have some OP 4 questions.  Its not really outlined in the event description I have printed out so....<br/><br/>1.  Are the Planetary Defense tokens treated like obstacles (roll for damage if passing through them, +1 defense dice if shooting through them) or like ships (back up and lose action if colliding with one, no defense bonus shooting through it)?  <br/><br/>2.  Are the PDs considered 'enemy ships' for purposes of Cloaked Mine placement?<br/><br/>3.  Does the planet block the range of the PDs?  ie, if my ship is very close to the planet and I attack Starfleet HQ, will only 2 PDs be within range 2 (total attack of 4) or are all 4 considered within range 2 despite being on the other side of the planet (total retaliation of 8 dice)?  I am assuming it would be 8 as the description says nothing about being in their firing arc, beyond the range restriction, but I reason that with the other details being absent this might be good to have firmly clarified.  <br/><br/>Thanks!</div>

When looking at Scotty's card, only the first ability includes the term 'ACTION:'. <br/><br/>Am I reading it correctly then that the 2nd ability (repairing shields) does not require an action?<br/><br/>Many thanks.</div>

I haven't set up OP4 yet to test, but I think it's possible to only have a single PD be able to shoot at a ship because of the planet. Remember, it's nearest point to nearest point between shooter & target.</div>

The reason I don't want my cloaked mines down first is that I don't want him to place his near mine! Through playing I have learned about this-- but of course in the next game it came down to:<br/><br/>"Are you placing your cloaked mines?"<br/>"I don't think so."<br/>"Okay."<br/>"Wait... You're not going to place yours?"<br/>"I only need to place mine if you place yours."<br/><br/>It then became an issue as we were both playing around with using the mines as counters...<br/><br/>Ascending initiative order of captain skill? NOT faction initiative? I do really need to know the answer for this!</div>

Scotty's ability is <br/><br/>"Action: Thing A <b>OR</b> Thing B". <br/><br/>You do Scotty's action and choose which thing he's going to do. Both things require the Action.<br/><br/>And no, you can't do Scotty's Action twice (getting an action from Martok, for example) choosing each part once. Scotty only has 1 Action.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure this has been answered elsewhere in the FAQ, but it isn't in the first post.</div>

Tournament question: why the heck are there so many 'commendation award tokens'?<br/><br/>The tournament rules read:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>COMMENDATION AWARD TOKEN (starting in Month 2):<br/>The previous month’s Admiral will be given 1 Commendation Award Token at the start of the next month’s tournament.

A Commendation Award Token may be spent during any one of that month’s Battle Rounds to re-roll any 1 of their attack or defense dice.

Discard Farek and 1 (Crew) Upgrade on the target ship.  If there is a (Scan) Token beside your ship, you may perform this action as a free Action.<br/><br/><b><i>Mr. Spock</i></b> - If your ship has a (Scan) Token beside it when you attack, you may convert all your (Battle Stations) results into (Hit) results. <br/><br/>(2) And more thread-related, it seems printer friendly mode only shows up to Nov 7th.

Ok this is the stupidest question I think I have ever asked but I can't convince myself I'm right… <br/><br/>The text on the Reinforcements Sideboard suggests to an opponent of mine that you must run it with one of every type of card it holds.. <br/><br/>"1) Prior to the event, players select 1 of each of the following card types and places them in the appropriate section of the Reinforcements Sideboard: 1 Captain Card, 1 [Elite Talent] Card, 1 [Crew] Upgrade, 1 [Tech] Upgrade and 1 [Weapon] Upgrade. The total cost of these cards may not exceed 20" <br/><br/>So she suggests I can't say put two 10 point cards (because of +5 penalties) on it, or some combination that doesn't fill it… <br/><br/>That seems like it should be wrong, and is wrong… but I'd love an official ruling for next time she and I are across a table from each other. <br/><br/>PS: my local store has already agreed with my interpretation  </div>

It seems the OP3 prize ship's ability is a bit...singularly conflicting with others.<br/><br/>The PWB Aj'Rmr reads:<br/>"Each time you attack, you may re-roll 1 of your attack dice for every damage card assigned to your ship"<br/><br/>...I assume that means there is no point to picking up a target lock for regular combat with this ship, correct?  As a target lock would allow you to re-roll any of your dice, but you can only re-roll a given dice once (unless using a Romulan Tactical Officer with a target lock), so...target lock does nothing, here?<br/><br/>Similarly, with weapons that re-roll results?  Like plasma torpedoes:<br/><br/>"Attack: [Target Lock] Spend your target lock and disable this card to perform this attack.  You may re-roll all your blank results one time."<br/><br/>Again, I'm assuming the Aj'Rmr's special ability has no real effect, here - a dice re-rolled from the plasma torpedo result cannot be re-rolled from the Aj'Rmr's special ability?</div>

Does a Planet block the firing arc of a ship? This matters for cards like the Ferengi EM Pulse:<br/><br/>"ACTION: Disable this card to target a ship at Range 1-2 that is not in your forward firing arc. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside the target ship. The target ship rolls 2 less attack dice this round."<br/><br/>I know a Planet blocks fire <i>during combat</i> (page 23), but does it block other effects outside of combat?<br/><br/>My guess is no because you can Target Lock through a planet, although that doesn't care about firing arc.</div>

It's still participating, so if it's cloaked it would decloak and because the ship is affected by a critical that says during your next attack you don't roll any attack dice then it would make sense that the combined attack is affected by this as well.<br/><br/>However, then I think this ruling should be tweaked because if the supporting ship rolls two less attack dice this round (from some effect for example), the combined attack should also be affected.  Right now, though, it isn't because it uses the printed attack value.</div>

For OP-4; the PDT are considered ships, are they also considered being connected to starfleet HQ, as though starfleet HQ is doing the attack?</div>

Kind of - you still pay the +5, but it's offset against the 20 points items on the sideboard.

I need several questions clarified that may have already been answered over these 52 pages;<br/><br/>1) For mines (Cloaked mines or antimatter mines) are the permanent or is there a way to get ride of them? Someone told me if you land on them they are removed after that round.<br/><br/>2) Can you again clarify + traits (like Donatra "All other friendly ships within Range 1 of your ship gains +1 attack die" or Gowron's "ACTION: All other friendly Klingon ships within Range 1-2 of your ship gain +1 attack die this round" or Clark's "All other friendly ships within Range 1 of your ship gains +1 defense die"). When do these bonus dice get added? Gowron's I assume when action is performed where as Donatra occurs when attacking? Does it only require the ship to have been in range before moving or moving into range? Then there is the difference in wording some are for the round some are when attacking, which confuses me.<br/><br/>3) Question about I stab at thee/Cheat death. Lets say a ship is destroyed by and action can you then use I stab at thee, followed by cheat death and since I stab at thee is not destroyed if it was attacked during the attack phase could it use the ability a second time that round? I guess what I am asking is can cards use their abilities multiple times per round. This is towards other cards as well like Scotty.<br/><br/>Montgomery Scott for example. He says disable him to perform his action, could you use Mecoy to perform as a free action and then perform it a second time as your action and disable him?<br/><br/></div>

For the sideboard, do you have to have one of each type of upgrade on there or just up to one of each matching 20 points. In the latest OP I put four different ones adding up to 20 on there but didn't have an elite talent. <br/><br/>It wouldn't have changed the outcome since I could have put some cheaper stuff on there and gotten them all, but I'd appreciate knowing if I did it right. Thanks!</div>

The "Attacking Through Obstacles" section and the "Planet Token" section both say "When measuring range during combat". If you read the section "Range" in the Combat section on page 13, it says very clearly: "To measure range, place the Range 1 end of the range ruler so that it touches the closest part of the attacker's base. Then point the ruler toward the closest part of the target ship's base that is inside the attacker's firing arc."<br/><br/>The rulebook could have made this issue clearer by mentioning the firing arc on pages 22 - 23, no question, but since it specifically refers to measuring range during combat, the rules as written are correct.</div>

New question regarding the Flagship resources.<br/><br/>More correctly the Independent Flagship options.<br/><br/>The Card states:<br/><br/>"If an independent option is chosen, players may assign any ship as their Flagship, and pay no Faction penalty."<br/><br/>How does this work exactly:<br/><br/>1. The ship keeps becomes Independent faction and then pays no penalty for independent captains and upgrades but now pays them for cards from all other factions.<br/><br/>2. The ship becomes Independent faction and pays no penalty for any cross faction cards.<br/><br/>3. The Flagship becomes Dual Faction i.e. Independent <b>and</b> the chosen ship's faction and pays no penalty on cards from either it's original faction or the Independent faction but still pays penalties on cards from neither of these factions.<br/><br/></div>

If a ship can perform a non-standard Action that is range-limited, for example using an EM Pulse, can the player measure to see what ships are in range before committing to the action (similar to Target Lock)?<br/><br/>And if the answer is "no," a followup question: If a player can use a range-limited action, does he have to commit to the target ship before measuring the range (potentially wasting the action if the targeted ship is too far away), or if he commits to the action can he then check which ships are in range before choosing the target ship. The language of EM pulse, for example, is "target a ship at range 1-2."<br/><br/>thanks<br/></div>

People of Star Trek Attack Wing, I have one question that is answered in the FAQ, but I would just like double confirmation on this about the Reinforcement Sideboard.<br/><br/>Even though the card says "During the Activation Phase of any round, a player may use a ships action to..." (ect)<br/><br/>The FAQ says that cards on the board can only be accessed once per round.<br/><br/>So for example I have 3 ships, and as an action on each of those ships I could ONLY access the Sideboard with one ship as one action?<br/><br/><br/>If so... Isn't that like, false advertisement? I really had my hopes up for this!</div>

The Flagship becomes Dual Faction i.e. Independent <b>and</b> the chosen ship's faction and pays no penalty on cards from either it's original faction or the Independent faction but still pays penalties on cards from neither of these factions.<br/><br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>#3 is correct.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>So does it activate as the first available Faction in the order? A Fed/Independent Flagship would activate as a Fed?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Correct.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>How would a (Faction)/Neutral flagship interact with the Unified Fleet Admiral's order?  I assume since it becomes dual faction either neutral upgrades or upgrades of the ships faction are both legal.<br/><br/>For example, if I have a Federation ship and use one of the Neutral flagship resources with it, could I put Khan and Spock on this ship and still be in compliance with the Admiral's Order requirement?<br/><br/>Relevant text from Admiral's Order/Unified Force:<br/>"You may deploy this card only if the captain and all upgrades on each of your ships match the faction of the ship itself."<br/><br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I would say yes. The ship is Fed and Ind. The Captain is Ind so matches the ships faction while the upgrade is Fed and also matches the ships faction. There is no requirement that the captain has to have the same faction as the upgrades.<br/><br/></div>

OP-4 question about star fleet headquarters.<br/><br/>1)Can you target lock star fleet headquarters, this way you can you torpedoes?<br/><br/>And/or<br/><br/>2)Can you even attack with secondary weapons (Forward disruptors). Some secondary weapons don't require target lock could they be used? Or can you only attack with primary weapons. <br/><br/>Thank you and happy thanksgiving!</div>

Hi Andrew, thanks again for your support! Wanted to ask a question about Barrage of Fire. I know there have been a lot of questions regarding this already, but I'm not sure if I'm reading it right or not:<br/><br/><b>FAQ</b><br/>14. If a ship's attack is increased in some way, does this also boost its "Primary Weapon Value" for purposes of the Barrage of Fire?<br/><br/>No. Use the ship's printed "Primary Weapon Value." This can only be increased if the ship becomes your Flagship (OP Month 4).<br/><br/>Does the ship with BoF get bonuses from, for example, Donatra or LE Martok? As I read this, just the 'support' ship's primary attack value isn't affected by those bonuses. But the firing ship would get 4 attack dice, +1 for Donatra, +1 for LE Martok, and +(primary attack value of support ship). Is that correct?</div>

The second ship is participating in the attack, but it's the first that is making the actual attack.  Also if the participating ship is affected by something (i.e. roll two less attack dice this round), it doesn't reduce the BoF attack by two since BoF uses the printed attack value of the ship.  However, that second ship still must be able to attack to participate (so "you cannot attack this round" will stop it).</div>

I have searched the FAQ and I can't find a mention of the "obstacle" nature of the minefield causing or not causing damage the way any other obstacle does.<br/><br/>Thought therefore it was a valid question to ask to clarify as the question has come up with mines I've placed that my opponents land on.</div>

So this question is concerning the rules surrounding what happens to an opponents ship when they perform a red maneuver while under auxiliary power.<br/>I know that if they are near the playing area edge that you can fling them thru the energy barrier and so remove them from the game.<br/><br/>But my question is for when they are near the planet and pull a red while under auxiliary power.<br/>Can you "crash" them into the planet and so either destroy them outright (arrrrrgh, our engines have failed and we are going down captain!!!) or at least make them have to roll for damage as per the obstacle rules for other obstacles?<br/>Or do they just go as far as the planet and then stop at that point along the movement template chosen?<br/><br/>I'm assuming they just stop at the planet token edge but I wanted to ask to be sure.<br/></div>

On the "pass over/cross thru" question, that was answered by Andrew that as long as your base is not touching the planet you are ok.<br/><br/>It represents your ship "orbiting" the planet as a 2D representation of a 3D action.<br/>So you can "fly thru" a planet (really just you orbiting 'underneath' the token to appear on the other side).</div>

Cloak upgrade cards.<br/>I've seen it mentioned elsewhere that a ship that cloaks can't sensor echo unless it somehow has the sensor echo icon.

Last night we were playing and came up with a question. We were using he DS9 token like in the OP1 (not owned by anyone and can be taken over). Part way though the game I took a turn near the edge of DS9 and decided to attack the station by dropping antimatter mines on it. Now I would assume that the first turn is an attack with the mines so it will damage the station. But on the next turn would the mines roll to damage the station since the station doesn't move?  Does this attack count as an attack from my ship on the next turn or would it be coming from the mine token itself?<br/><br/>Antimatter mines:  Attack: Discard this card and place a Minefield Token in your rear firing arc at Range 1. If you place this token on a ship, or if a ship enters the minefield, roll 4 attack dice. Any [DAMAGE] or [CRITICAL] damages the ship as normal. The affected ship does not roll any defense dice.</div>

Can a ship with Spock, Dmitri Valtane and/or Geordi all use their abilities off a single scan token? None of them are actually spending the scan token so you are not actually using the scan token.

Hi i've got a question about the "United Force" Admirals order specifically with the following line:-<br/><br/>1) During Set-up, you may spend an additional 10 sp on upgrades....etc<br/><br/>what is meant by "Set-up"???? does this mean at the begining of the tournament or at the beginning of each game/round as if its that latter i can see this being rather abused for list tailoring.</div>

So, no 110 pt "ships equipped with only a captain" swarms.  For example, it's the difference between an 8 ship and a 9 ship Romulan science vessel swarm.  96 for 8, 108 for 9.</div>

Once a list is set for the tournament, it cannot be changed between games. The same is true, for example, with command tokens. The five you start with are the five you keep throughout the tourney.

only the ones that specifically modify attack or defense dice. as usual, ship token/actions do not affect the surface. They affect Troop attacks, and they *probably* affect mine attacks but I don't recal ever getting that part cleared up.</div>

That said, you can fire 6 in any direction at range 1, but only 5 at range 2.

It has been ruled previously that they can be with the specific ones I mentioned. If you're referring to line two, that's referring to the fact that you can only use it on your dice, as opposed to forcing the opponent to reroll. However, the wording definitely does leave it open to interpretation that way and we could use another ruling just in case.<br/><br/>"2) A player may only use Command Tokens for his/her ships."<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Andrew Parks wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#6F4C0C><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>csimian wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#2121A4><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Andrew Parks wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i><font color=#0B5C0D><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Jaels wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>In OP3, can you use the Command Tokens Resource to affect the planet battle (adding or rerolling dice)?

Sorry I've got some month 3 questions as our event is on Sunday.<br/><br/>I'm sure the answer to the first question is yes, but my second question is dependent to it being a yes.<br/><br/>If you win all 3 games and control the planet you would be on 9 battle points. If you wing all 3 games but not control the planet in any game you would be on 6 battle points (because you would not recieve the bonus points for controlling the planet. The total battle points over the 3 games decide the overal winner.<br/><br/>Assuming that's a yes when does the game end based on the following situation?<br/><br/>In the 30th minute my opponent loses their last ship but has troops on the planet. Does the game end immediately as he has lost his last ship, or do I have the next 30 minutes to attack his troops on the planet and take control of the planet for the extra battle point?</div>

When a card ability allows a player to gain a certain number of attack or defense dice "this round" (for example, Scotty), how does this work?<br/><br/>For attack dice, this allows the player to add that many attack dice (in total) to his attack rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If a player is able to make multiple attacks during the same Combat Phase, the player may choose when to add the bonus attack dice. These dice can even be added to Secondary Weapon attacks.<br/><br/>For defense dice, this allows the player to add that many defense dice (in total) to his defense rolls during that round's Combat Phase. If the player is attacked multiple times during the same Combat Phase, the player can choose when to add the bonus defense dice.<br/><br/>Note that this type of text is different from a continuous bonus which does not use the phrase "this round" (for example, the text on Donatra or Terrell). A continuous bonus applies to all attack and defense rolls made by the affected ships during that round.  </div>

So Antimatter mines.  Here's what I get from the FAQ:<br/><br/>The turn they are played, cards can effect them the turn they come out like Donatra, Scotty, etc giving them more dice.<br/><br/>Also tokens like battlestations and target lock do not work with them, nor can they be evaded.<br/><br/>So the grey area I do not see covered is a card like Spock that neither modifies the number nor is a token.  Do Spock and similar qaulity enhancers work with the antimatter mines the turn they are played?</div>

There for if you use Scotty and have donatra it will become a 7 attack dice. I believe the reason you can't use battle stations is it doesn't follow the normal combat phase (defender doesn't roll defense dice).<br/><br/>As for Spock I would say seeing as his ability requires the use of a scan token the answer is no, because again action tokens can only be used during normal combat phase.

She came to the same ruling that Gowron, with the "this round" text, only gives +1 die <i>total</i> during the round, but Donatra can give more than 1 die.<br/><br/>I can see the need for "this round" text though. If Gowron didn't have the "this round" text and did his Action, then it could be argued that I get +1 attack die on later rounds, several rounds after Gowron performed his Action. Clearly that's not what was intended.<br/><br/>Donatra doesn't have the same problem because her ability is based on the target ship, not on what she does. Her card is only checked when the target ship attacks. If it's in Range 1 at the time the attack is declared, it gets +1 die.<br/><br/>This is such a messy, messy verbiage though. It would be far, far cleaner to say there's only +1 die total during the entire round no matter what the card says. Or each card can only be triggered once per round.</div>

I have a pair of linked question for a dominion build I am making that I couldn’t  find an answer to in the FAQ. If I have Forward Weapons Grid (Attack: Disable this card to perform this attack.

A question about OP4 and how it interacts with ships that can split their attack into two separate attacks.<br/><br/>The OP Document says this about firing at Starfleet Headquarters:<br/><i>If a ship inflicts at least 1 damage to the SHQ, the player that inflicted the damage removes one of the Mission Tokens from the SHQ and places it beside his Ship Cards. NOTE: Only 1 Mission Token can be removed from the SHQ Token from any single attack, regardless of how much damage was inflicted by that attack.</i><br/><br/>The first half says that getting a token is based on a ship. If a ship deals at least 1 damage, then remove a token. Does that mean that a ship dealing multiple damage over multiple attacks in one turn still only removes one token?</div>

this was answered before if someone else wants to do a search on it. I haven't had any luck finding it though. It was a comparison between the Reliant's ability and Antoproton Scan with regards to FWG and antiproton was ruled to give +1 against each target. it should be a very old thread or post like back in august/september</div>

My only reason for raising the question is because I've seen some comments about the sideboard stating you couldn't bring anything over if you didn't have anything to swap it with.<br/><br/>Say you started with no crew, you couldn't bring a crew card over, slot or not, because you started crewless.<br/><br/>I agree that doesn't match the rules listed on the card.<br/>But I've seen posts where such seemed to be stated as a limitation to the sideboard.</div>

Andrew, I could not find this question asked, and appologize in advance it it has been and answered.<br/><br/>Are the Sutherland's "Secondary Torpedo Launcher" considered a "torpedo" for things like the Gor Portas ability listed below:<br/><br/>"Although you must be Target Locked on a ship to fire a Torpedo at it, you do not need to discard your Target Lock when doing so."<br/><br/>Would you be able to "keep" your target lock by firing the Secondary Torpedo Launcher from the Gor Portas? (Assuming you fired your first Torpedo volley already in the round from the Gor Portas)<br/><br/>Thanks! <br/></div>

May we please get a clarification on the order of operations for the Romulan Pilot? The card reads like this: <br/><br/><b>After you move, you may discard this card to place a [scan] Token beside your ship as a free Action. If you do so, you may immediately make an additional Green Maneuver.</b><br/><br/>So when does the action step happen in that line? Between the moves? After? Does the free action scan happen between them but the action step after the second move? <br/><br/>Part of the reason I am asking is using a Romulan Pilot alongside the Romulan Flagship. When does the flagships free action Sensor Echo occur if you use the pilot in a given turn? <br/><br/>Also while I think I know this answer, while I have you, the green maneuver granted from the Romulan Pilot counts for the named Valdor ship correct? <br/><br/>Thanks in advance for the sage wisdom. </div>

This card has the same "after you move" wording as Martok(8). You would have to use the card immediately after being done with your move, before you take any of your own actions. Classifying it a "free action" here would mean you can't do it if you bump. Since the scan must happen immediately, the additional (optional) movement would also happen before the normal time to use actions (and thus could still be subject to bumping rules if you bump in the second maneuver).</div>

Also the scan is a free action, which as Andrew stated players decided the order in which actions are taken.<br/><br/>The only thing is if you choose to use this card the green maneuver must be used immediately after placing the scan, this wording means that if you then move into a cloaked minefield the scan no longer helps because the cloaked mines require you to immediately perform a scan after moving into range, but if you move into the field and then use the card the minefield would only hit with 2 attack dice and you would then get to do your green maneuver.</div>

Few questions:<br/><br/>1. If I use Captain Data and flip their cloak tokens to red, and they activate after Data due to higher skill, can they use their actions to flip those cloak tokens back to green in the same round? I'm finding Captain Data's low skill is making his ability hard enough to use as it is.<br/><br/>2. USS Enterprise (Constitution Class) says it may perform an action listed on its bar while it has an aux. power token. The new flagship cards make your action on your bar a free action if you already have it. Since the Enterprise does not say "one" or any other restriction, does this mean I can perform the action on my bar that counts as a free action (due to flagship upgrade) and still get to perform another action on the bar with its rule? Since both actions would be on its bar, and it allows its bar actions to be performed in spite of the aux token...<br/><br/>3. what's the technical difference, if any, between "firing" and "attacking?" <br/><br/>overall enjoying the game, though everyone at the store just has fleets which every ship cloaks with an AWS upgrade. </div>

Not sure how to explain this one correctly but the difference did come up recently regarding Antiproton Scan in combination with Forward Weapons Grid.<br/><br/>Forward Weapons Grid allows you to split 1 attack between 2 targets.<br/><br/>Antiproton Scan states "...add +1 attack die when firing against a ship...". As a ship that uses a Forward Weapons grid is firing at each ship it may add +1 Attack die against each target (so long as they both have no active shields).<br/><br/>If, however, Antiproton Scan had said "....add +1 Attack die each time you attack...", then Forward Weapons Grid would only let you add +1 dice total (not +1 for each ship) as you are only making one attack.<br/><br/>Facing, cloaking ships with AWS the combo (Weyoun and Miles O'Brian becomes priceless) though for pure faction Miles O'Brian is still useful by himself.</div>

Martok does  work, but only those 4 Action types listed on the 1701's Action Bar. The Independent (Fed side) Flagship card on another nearby ship would let the 1701 get 3 actions while it has an Aux token. "After your Flagship moves, you may target 1 other friendly ship within Range 1 of your Flagship. Target ship immediately performs a 2nd Action listed on its Action Bar as a free Action this round." (Just make sure this is 2nd Action the 1701 takes, not the 1st or 3rd.)<br/><br/>If there were more ways to give the 1701 it's choice of free Actions,  then the it could do up to 4 Actions, 1 each of Scan, Battlestations, Target Lock, Evade. Since nothing can take the same Action twice, 4 would be the limit.</div>

Okay, sorry but I got a new sling of questions. Like, a huge list. <br/><br/>1. Getting the stupid question out of the way on behalf of some other locals. Is this faq official, for both casual and/or tournament play? We have a couple people at our store who don't consider any rulings or faq official unless it's on the wizkids site. They're like, REALLY upset that the faq is on this site and apparently being on this site makes it officially unofficial, somehow. <br/><br/>2. Will there be any plans for an official faq on any wizkids owned/endorsed site? <br/><br/>3. Disobey orders says "you may discard this card at any time to replace one scan, evasion or battlestations token beside your ship with one scan, evasion or battlestations token. since I can modify my attack dice in the order of my choosing, can I use dmitri with the scan token I have, then use Disobey Orders to switch it to battlestations in the modify dice step to spend it on my BS rolls?<br/><br/>4. Another Disobey Orders question, though this is just to confirm I understand the intention of the multiple triggers rule vs disobey Orders. Let's say I have Spock and Dmitri. After rolling attack dice, I choose to reroll two blanks with Dmitri. DO allows me to swap a scan token for a scan token - if the answer to #3 was yes, could I swap a scan token for a scan token so that Spock will technically trigger off of a separate token? I don't think this is the case, but I wish to be thorough if I'm already asking about disobey orders.<br/><br/>5. Jadzia Dax disables herself to let me perform a 2 maneuver, provided I do not attack. In terms of maneuver color/difficulty, does it go by my ship's dial or is it automatically treated as white? <br/><br/>6. For tournaments: Kirk's medals are purchased at 3 points each and set down next to him, meant to be secret from your opponent. But in tournaments, I have come to understand the opponents initial on your sheet each round to confirm he's checked your list for legality purposes. So how am I supposed to utilize Kirk's one advantage in a tournament when people can just look and see my upgrades? <br/><br/>7. Final question I swear! (had to add this in, this actually came up today) My friend and I play the Wrath of Khan Nebula battle scenario, in which shields are always down, and bumping makes both ships take damage unless you roll enough evades, and so on. He takes his Khan on Miranda with one hull point to bumps into my CC Enterprise with one hull point, and we both fail our rolls and die. My Kirk on Enterprise has Cheat Death and he has Stab at Thee. I cheat the death from the bump, then he blows me up with Stab at Thee since he died from the same bump. Does anyone win? I see the rule in the book about simultaneous destruction awarding victory to the player with initiative, and I'm not sure if there was anything I could do to live due to timing. It just seemed to be a really weird timing situation...<br/><br/><br/>Many thanks for your time!!</div>

Those are NOT on the Enterprise's Action Bar, they're on Jean-Luc Picard.<br/><br/>Also, Andrew gave my previous comment on this a "thumbs up", so this is the correct answer. He isn't making a separate comment if other people have already responded. He just thumbs up the answer. Much, much faster.</div>

A question on Weapons Platforms as they relate to the OPs. Since for the OP they do not have shields and are considered a ship, can a ship with Tribbles beam any unwanted amount of Tribbles onto a Weapons Platform?

Andrew, there is one important thing that has been lacking from this FAQ.  The word "Official" at the top.  There are those who disregard the work you've put into keeping this collected and current and continue to argue their dodgy interpretations of the rules and apply them in tournament games.  That one change would save a great deal of frustration for the majority of us who play the game's rules as written and clarified by it's designers when visiting venues that play by an imagined set of rules or when discussing the merits and implications of various rulings on this and other message boards.  <br/><br/>Thank you.    </div>

Typically I've seen it that OP prizes are legal in the next months event, though some venues allow you to use whatever, and some allow you to use that months OP participation reward during that event.  But it's up to the venue/TO entirely.  <br/><br/>Pretty much "it's at the discretion of the venue/TO" is the answer to any question about meta-rules for OP events.</div>

Picard is allowing you to perform y as free actions, y being all the abilities Picard's card lets you choose from. While set X and set Y have the same actions in the case of Picard on Enterprise, Picard is NOT read as "you may perform actions listed on your ship's bar as a free action." He gives you an action, he does not modify your pre-existing bar. You cannot assume that because his options are the same as his ship's options, that he modifies your ship's actions in any way. And here are just a few distinguishers:<br/><br/>1. "You may use this action even if your ships does not have it in the action bar" supports the fact that it is Picard's list of actions, that can be similar but is not necessarily the same and therefore does not equate to your ship's bar being the source. Picard is clearly the source, with his list being choices from said separate source.<br/><br/>2. His card reads "you may perform one of the following actions as a free action" While there are other abilities like "target a ship in range 1... that ship can perform an action listed on its bar as a free action." One says "here's MY list you can take from," and the other says "take from your own list and do it"<br/><br/>3. And of course, the flagship action rule that says if you already have the action on your bar, it becomes a free action instead. <br/><br/>This is some night-and-day stuff. It's about the source of the action, not whether the action is the same as listed on your bar. The Enterprise would check to see where the action is coming from, see you trying to scan because of picard, and go "hey it has to come from MY list and not yours." Picard could say "but we have the same scan!" Enterprise just says "Don't matter none, it has to be MY scan from MY list"</div>

The word "You" is defined to refer to ships, so Picard on the Enterprise allows the Enterprise to perform an action, and the Enterprise can perform actions listed on its action bar while under Auxiliary Power. There is nothing that distinguishes Picard from other upgrades that grant a ship actions, so there is no reason to errata in a special exception for Picard and similar captains. The rules as written already handle this situation without ambiguity.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Just to clarify this ruling:<br/><br/>The Enterprise lets you perform an Action from its Action Bar even if you have an Auxiliary Power Token. Since the Flagship effectively adds an Action to the ship's Action Bar, it allows the Enterprise to perform the added Action even while under Auxiliary Power.<br/><br/>It is true that it is the ship that performs the Action, but in this case it is a question of the source of that Action. The intention of the Enterprise's ability is that it allows you to perform one of its native Ship Actions under dire circumstances. Therefore, when an Action is derived from its Action Bar (including one added to its Action Bar by the Flagship), then it can be performed while under Auxiliary Power. Picard does not add his Action to the ship's Action Bar, and that is why the ship cannot perform one of Picard's bonus Actions while under Auxiliary Power. This is how the Enterprise and Picard have interacted since the game released.<br/><br/>I understand Paul's argument, as he is focusing on the words "listed on" and taken literally, his argument has merit. However, (and please forgive this somewhat Clintonian explanation), it's all in how you define "listed" in this case. In this case, the intention of the word "listed" is that the Action is coming from the Ship's Action Bar and not another source. I understand the other interpretation as well, but this is why we have FAQ's, so that ambiguous text can be given a final clarification.</div>

The only disadvantage to having a STAW think tank is all the darned rules questions that come up...<br/><br/>1. Is there any legal way the attack dice from I Stab at Thee can be modified by the ship's owner from his abilities/effects? <br/><br/>2. When you transwarp drive (allowing you to perform a 6 straight if you reveal a 4/5 straight), does the 6 maneuver you perform inherit the color of the 4/5 maneuver you revealed? <br/><br/>Thanks again!</div>

If you overlap a ship with your move, you can't take any actions, including free actions (Like Romulan Pilot).  So you wouldn't be able to trigger her in the first place for either effect.</div>

If you were approaching the rules like a deterministic robot, you could make a case that a card called "Captain Sulu" was not the same unique card as one called "Lieutenant Sulu," but they're both called "Haikaru Sulu" so it's not even an issue.</div>

Question on Boheeka:<br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>If your ship has a Battle Stations Token beside it when you attack, you may convert 1 blank result into 1 Hit result. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>After you roll your attack dice, could you change a blank result to a Hit and then cash in the Battle Stations to change the BS die results?

You modify dice in any order after rolling. So the way that I would do it is to use Boheeka's effect, if applicable/desired, then spend the battle stations token, if applicable/desired. Doing it the other way would mean you no longer had the token to apply the effect to a blank die with.</div>

If anything, the ability conferred by the flagship card gives rise to the idea. The card does not state it becomes dual faction - that was something added in this topic by the designer.<br/><br/>I just wanted to hear confirmation. I came to the same conclusion, but the fact that a lot of people think otherwise suggests it needs an entry in the FAQ.<br/><br/></div>

Questions regarding OP3 and OP4.<br/><br/>The Koranak's ability: "Instead of making a normal attack, you may spend a [SCAN] Token to attack 2 different ships with your Primary Weapon at -2 attack dice each."<br/><br/>In cases such as this where the attack is split between multiple ships,<br/><br/>1) Is this considered a single attack, or two separate ones? If it is two separate attacks, can it be used to attack with troops on the planet as well as on a ship for -2 attack dice? If the troop attack can occur, does it suffer a -2 attack dice penalty from the Koranak's ability?<br/><br/>2) In OP4, does the SFHQ Token count as one of the "2 different ships" the Koranak can use this ability to target?</div>

FWG: "Attack: Disable this card to perform this attack. You must divide the attack between 2 different ships in your forward firing arc. You may divide your attack dice however your like, but you must roll at least 1 attack die against each ship."<br/>But the Koranak doesn't say <b>Attack:</b> at the start of it's ability.

The criteria for each individual Order must be met by your fleet in order to equip it to your fleet. NOTE: Admiral’s Orders are not considered Resources.<br/>2)Each month of the OP tournament, players may choose from the current Admiral’s Orders.<br/>3)Players must spend a number of Squadron Points (SP) to equip their fleet with an Admiral’s Order. The SP cost of an Admiral’s Order will be located on the Order’s reference card.<br/>4)Players cannot change Admiral’s Orders between Battle Rounds of a tournament.

You cannot change these Upgrades between Battle Rounds of tournament.<br/>2)Once per round, you may re-roll any one of your dice (even if it has already been re-rolled).<br/>3)You cannot place a Captain or Upgrade from the Reinforcements Sideboard onto a ship of a different Factions.<br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>If I build a fleet with 99 points and use the 'United forces' admirals orders (Which provides 10 extra fleet points) for purposes of initiative is my fleet still considered to be a 99 point fleet or am I now potential a 110 point fleet.<br/><br/>If the above answer is NO, that I would have a 110 point fleet and would not have initiative, does this then mean my opponent with 100 point fleet would now have initiative?<br/></div>

There for if you use Scotty and have donatra it will become a 7 attack dice. I believe the reason you can't use battle stations is it doesn't follow the normal combat phase (defender doesn't roll defense dice).<br/><br/>As for Spock I would say seeing as his ability requires the use of a scan token the answer is no, because again action tokens can only be used during normal combat phase. This might need further clarification from Andrew.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Since Spock only checks for the <i>presence</i> of a Scan token, and doesn't require it to be used, I would have to argue that he works.<br/><br/>I'd prefer if Antimatter mines were unalterable, rather then being this odd quasi-exception, but oh well.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I just had this very question, and searched and searched the FAQ to no avail. I was ready to post the question, then thought to check the other rules threads, and, lo and behold, this was answered before <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1028616/im-trailing-mines" target="_blank" class="postlink" rel="nofollow">http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1028616/im-trailing-mines</a> (and probably should be added to the FAQ):<br/><br/><font color=#6F0C0C><div class='quote'><div class='quotetitle'><p><b>Andrew Parks wrote:</b></p></div><div class='quotebody'><i>If you increase or decrease the total amount of attack dice for the round, then it will affect Antimatter Mines for the turn that you drop them (if you drop them right onto someone).<br/><br/>Spock and Drex would work similarly (i.e. only the round that you drop the Mines).<br/>Andrew</i></div></div></font></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>So reading the rules FAQ on the first page this is what I find:<br/><br/>"However, since the Antimatter Mines are a special form of attack that do not follow the normal rules of the Combat Phase, you cannot use Target Lock or Battle Stations tokens to modify the attack dice (and your opponent cannot use Evade tokens to cancel)."<br/><br/>Spock would use need a scan token to have his text work and seeing as you can't use tokens to modify this attack I question if Spock truly would be able to use his abilities.<br/><br/>Andrew if you could give a yes or no.<br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Spock just needs the Scan Token to be sitting next to the ship so his text works. That is very different than spending a token like Target Lock or Battle Stations during the normal combat sequence (which is not used when dropping the Antimatter Mines).</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Can we get the FAQ updated/clarified with what effects can and cannot modify attack dice from Antimatter mines please? Specifically, this entry:<br/><font color=#6F4C0C><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>9. Can the attack dice rolled for Antimatter Mines be modified in any way?<br/><br/>Yes, but only when you drop the Minefield Token directly on top of another ship. In this case, the number of attack dice can be altered by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra; you may also substitute the Elite Attack Die for one of the normal attack dice. However, since the Antimatter Mines are a special form of attack that do not follow the normal rules of the Combat Phase, you cannot use Target Lock or Battle Stations tokens to modify the attack dice (and your opponent cannot use Evade tokens to cancel hits).<br/><br/>If a ship later moves onto or through an already placed Minefield Token, the dice cannot be altered at all, even by card effects such as Scotty, Kyle, and Donatra.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>It is not at all clear from this and other comments throughout these 60some pages what is allowed and what isn't to change or add to those initial attack dice. It sounds like no<i> tokens</i> can be <i>spent</i> but other effects can modify those dice, including effects based off other tokens, like Spock & Scan. Is that correct? Can this be added to the FAQ please? There has been much debate and discussion about Antimatter Mines in relation to  how their attack can be modified around here.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Andrew if this is included can it also be specified for cloaked mines.<br/><br/>Thank you</div>

Question on an Admiral's order. <br/><br/>"United Force- You may only deploy this order if the captain and all upgrades on each of your ships match the same faction as the ship itself... 1)During Set Up, you may spend an additional 10 SP on Upgrades, as long as each Upgrade is deployed to a ship of its own Faction. You cannot change these upgrades between Battle Rounds of a tournament."<br/><br/>Does this order require you all your ships to be of the same faction, or may you use ships of different factions so long as your captains and upgrades all match the faction of the ship they are on?<br/><br/>Many thanks</div>

1. I'm just making sure I didn't miss anything - except for flagship resources, upgrades from the "independent" faction invoke point penalties for squad building? I'm pretty sure it does, as it almost disqualified my list from an event tonight (thankfully I built my list under on purpose in case initiative came up, so I didn't end up going over)<br/><br/>While you can't have Spock AND Dmitri both boosting your attack, can one of those two boost the attack from both my first Torpedoes AND the bonus attack from the Sutherland's Secondary Torpedo Launcher? (STL says you may discard it and fire it as a second attack if you fired torpedoes at someone the same turn)</div>

If the attacker has a chance to further enhance their attack with expense of a card, do they have to do decide to do so before or after the result of the crit is known?<br/><br/>For example, say I'm running Toreth:<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>When attacking, you may convert 1 [DAMAGE] result into a [CRITICAL] result.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>...with 'massacre':<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>If your ship inflicts a [CRITICAL] damage against an enemy's Hull, discard this card to inflict 1 additional damage to that ship.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>...and I'm firing on a target with 2 hull left.<br/><br/>Toreth takes her shot, and manages to get a single hit past the enemy defenses to land on the hull.<br/><br/>Her special ability turns that hit into a crit.  Now...I've landed a crit on the enemy hull...but he only has 2 hull left.  So if the crit is 'direct hit', that one hit ALONE will destroy them.  Obviously, I can choose to spend my 'massacre' card, right now on seeing the dice result, and inflict another extra hit anyway, but...<br/><br/>Well, I'd rather wait to see what that crit IS before deciding.<br/><br/>Can I?  IE., the enemy draws a crit card, reveals 'stunned helmsman', so I go ahead and play 'massacre' to destroy them...or they draw a crit card, reveal 'direct hit', and I just hold on to my 'massacre' card for a later target.  Or do I have to decide to use the card or not on seeing the dice result, BEFORE the card is actually drawn from the deck?</div>

I know that in cases of overlapping cloaked minefields, it is treated as just 1, but what if a ship ends up within range 1 of 2 mine tokens that are far enough apart that the 2 minefields do not overlap?  If the tokens are 9 inches apart with range 1 extending out 4 inches, the minefields do not overlap, but a ship could end up in both.  Is this treated as being in overlapping minefields which only does 1 attack or more like clearing 1 & entering another which does 2 attacks?</div>

So I hope the ruling is that it would only affect the ship being attacked, and the others overlapped would be affected normally by the mine (because with this attack there is no ship that could survive if every dice shows a hit, which is likely and have possible crits for additional damage, then every ship it touched would be destroyed).

Damage from Minefield tokens, either Cloaked Mines or Antimater Mines, happens during the Activation Phase.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Well just like antimatter mines can receive buffs, I read somewhere that Donatra buffs cloaked mines (I think it was here). And since the mines count as ships and are friendly it makes since.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>No, Cloaked Mines can't receive any buffs. Dropping Cloaked Mines are not done as an Attack like Antimatter Mines are. Antimatter Mines <i>only </i>receive modifiers the turn they are dropped on ships, not on later turns when a ship moves through them. You can never drop a Cloaked Mine directly on top of another ship since they must be placed at least Range 2 away from all enemy ships.<br/><br/>Mines, both cloaked and antimatter, also don't count as ships. Where did you read that?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Seems like there is some confusion here mistaking Orbital Weapon Platforms for Cloaked Mines.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I remember reading somewhere in this 66 page FAQ that Donatra would give her +1 attack to the cloaked mines because they are part of your fleet, and I think I assumed that meant ships. However, I can't find it again and maybe it wasn't an official ruling.</i></div></div></font><br/>Cloaked mines have enough cheese drifiting around them in space not to need any bonues from Donatra.. that would be crazy stupid <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"><br/>Might as well through in a +1 for coming out of cloak attack too <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/wink.gif" alt="" border="0"></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I do have to say they are fun to play with, but they aren't as bad as antimatter mines:<br/><br/>Comparison-<br/>Cloaked mines get 3 dice (-1 if enemy does a scan), defender gets no defense dice<br/><br/>Antimatter mines<br/>You get 4 dice (If you have the right fleet build you can increase; +1 from Donatra, +1 Martok, +2 Montgomery Scott, +1 N'vek, +1 attack dice from command bar, and Mr. Spock will turn battle stations to hits) meaning you could have 10 attack dice, and ability to reroll one attack dice and change battle stations to hits, DEFENDER GETS NO DEFENSE DICE<br/><br/>Another interesting thing is the mine plate is rather large and could potential touch up to 3 ship bases, which in my understanding means you would roll this attack for each ship, but that seems ludicrous. So I hope the ruling is that it would only affect the ship being attacked, and the others overlapped would be affected normally by the mine (because with this attack there is no ship that could survive if every dice shows a hit, which is likely and have possible crits for additional damage, then every ship it touched would be destroyed). Through in the new massacre card for that finishing touch. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>But one thing you seem to be forgetting is that in your example, that's about what?  53+ points at the very least?  Not to mention you have to drop them on somebody behind you.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Cloaked Mines are THREE POINTS, can be dropped in far more places easier and covers more ground, and stays in play but doesn't damage your own stuff.<br/><br/></div>

We know that Spock and Geordi cannot trigger of the same scan token. But, can cards like Spock and Drex trigger when you attack multiple times in one turn. For example, with Secondary Torpedo Launcher that came with Sutherland.<br/><br/></div>

I wanted some more clarification on the Long Range Tachyon Scan (LRTS). I've been reviewing the FAQ as to not try to repeat, but here goes. <br/><br/>1) I see Will Sanchez's response that LRTS is used like any attack modifier, but ships can only attack once (maybe twice with Counter Attack and split fire cards). However, a ship can defend more than once which would make an effect like "-2 defense for this round" ongoing, not one during one attack. <br/><br/>2) Projected Stasis field, is another card why I'm bringing this up. Say you target a ship with your highest skill captain, I assume the targeted ship's shields stay disabled after the attack for the remainder of Combat phase (against all other attacks)? If the target's shields stay disabled, why wouldn't LRTS have the same -2 defense against other attacks than just the first?<br/><br/>I'm really curious because LRTS was one of my favorite tools as a Dominion player until someone mentioned this FAQ post. Also - Thank you Andrew for making an awesome game.    </div>

I can't seem to find this question, so apologies if it has been asked already:<br/><br/>Can Counter Attack or Captain Riker's special ability trigger off of response damage abilities similar to themselves?  <br/><br/>For example:  if I shoot at Riker as my regular attack after declaring Counter Attack as my action, and he returns fire, can I use Counter Attack in response to any damage he does?<br/><br/>[q=Star Trek Attack Wing]Counter Attack:  Action: Once per turn If your ship's Shields or Hull are damaged by a ship in your forward firing arc this round, you may immediately make 1 free attack against that ship. You may not make this attack if your ship is destroyed.<br/><br/>William T Riker:  Action: Once per turn If you are attacked this round at Range 1, Roll 2 attack dice. Any DAMAGE or CRITICAL result damages the attacking ship as normal, even if your ship is destroyed by their attack. The attacking ship does not roll any defense dice. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Thank you for all the hard work you're putting into supporting this game and answering these questions!</div>

Since the Flagship effectively adds an Action to the ship's Action Bar, it allows the Enterprise to perform the added Action even while under Auxiliary Power.<br/><br/>It is true that it is the ship that performs the Action, but in this case it is a question of the source of that Action. The intention of the Enterprise's ability is that it allows you to perform one of its native Ship Actions under dire circumstances. Therefore, when an Action is derived from its Action Bar (including one added to its Action Bar by the Flagship), then it can be performed while under Auxiliary Power. Picard does not add his Action to the ship's Action Bar, and that is why the ship cannot perform one of Picard's bonus Actions while under Auxiliary Power. This is how the Enterprise and Picard have interacted since the game released.<br/><br/>I understand Paul's argument, as he is focusing on the words "listed on" and taken literally, his argument has merit. However, (and please forgive this somewhat Clintonian explanation), it's all in how you define "listed" in this case. In this case, the intention of the word "listed" is that the Action is coming from the Ship's Action Bar and not another source. I understand the other interpretation as well, but this is why we have FAQ's, so that ambiguous text can be given a final clarification.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>  To be honest I do not understand the logic on Ships and actions as it stands.  Especially when "literally" reading the card makes you wrong.  This thus requires that both parties read this post and understand it.  I prefer the more cut and dry "letter of the law" and thus while unintended Picard's abilites work on the Constitution Enterprise.  This concept of action coming from things other ships is really confusing.      <br/><br/>For example if I use Romulan Pilot what is the sorce of the free scan action.  Is it the ship or is it the crew member.  Do crew action count against ships actions.<br/><br/>I wish that all actions were were ruled as coming from the ship no matter what and thus Picard would be able to use his action on the Constitution Enterprise.</div>

I think I've done enough searching and couldn't find an answer to these questions.

When using Secondary Torpedo Launcher for a second attack, do any abilities of the initially fire torpedo apply (Battlestations turning to Crits, attack dice, etc.) <br/><br/>5) Does the one re-roll per die rule apply if my opponent forces the re-roll? (ex. Opponent uses Koloth to make me re roll an attack die. It comes up blank.

Anybody can feel free to correct me on anything if I'm wrong. But only if I'm wrong, Pah-wraiths take you if you in fact are the wrong one.<br/><br/>1) My interpreting of both cards is the defender would take 2 damage if the hit goes through, as the Quantum only triggers on a successful hit so it would happen after die modifications, but keep in mind you can still evade the 1 damage using the evade dice you rolled per a ruling earlier using only 1 evade.<br/><br/>2) Antiproton Scan is subject to the one ability per token rule, as it states any cards and not separately for each type, so no Breen Aide and Antiproton Scan. Otherwise that would be used quite a lot.<br/><br/>3) I believe this is also a no, as any action that would grant an extra move occur after step 4, Check for Power Strain, which is the step in which you place or remove aux tokens.<br/><br/>4) I'm going to say no, but I am not positive. I read it as you gain the +1 attack die or the convert 1 battlestations only happens for the torpedo that grants it, but I could see a case for if you did not use the battlestations conversion on your original torpedo that it could carry over as normally there is the dice pool that you can use with either one of multiple attacks such as with Missile Launchers.<br/><br/>5) I'll say yes, as it does explicitly state each die can only be rerolled once but it can be modified after a reroll.<br/><br/>6) What do I care, I'm not the designer? Or am I? No. No I am not.<br/><br/>Edited to realize I was saying you can reroll and also that you can't, and I wanted to make it clear that I was saying you can't reroll.</div>

If they use Interphase Generator, and do not cancel the single remaining hit, then Quantum Torpedoes will add one additional hit.<br/><br/>2 - Yes, the Antiproton scan triggers off of having a Scan token beside your ship. It will not combo with anything otherwise similar. (IE: No to the example.)<br/><br/>3 - Maybe? Is there currently anything that can grant a green maneuver that isn't itself an Action?

Once again, when asking about specific cards, don'[t forget to include the full text:<br/><br/>Quantum Torpedoes<br/>Attack: (Target Lock) Spend your target lock and disable this card to perform this attack. If the target ship is hit, add 1 [hit] result to your total damage. You may fire this weapon from your forward or rear firing arcs. <br/><br/>Interphase Generator:<br/>When defending while you are Cloaked, you may discard this card after all the dice have been rolled to reduce the damage from a single attack to exactly 1 [DAMAGE]. <br/><br/>1) It seems clear to me that adding a (hit) result after confirming your attack hits is part of the attack. Interphase generator reduces the total damage from the attack to -exactly- 1. You are not modifying the dice in any way, you are modifying the end result.<br/><br/>3) It has been ruled in previous cases that maneuvers taken that are green for a particular ship remove power tokens. Currently the only way to take advantage of this though is through the independent flagship. The same should apply if you're using Chekov but without knowing what specific card combo you're trying to use, I can't be certain if this is the answer you're looking for.<br/><br/>EDIT: 3 is true for the flagship but you can not take advantage of this with romulan pilot. Romulan Pilot is a free action, but you cannot take any actions while under the effects of auxiliary power.<br/><br/></div>

Hi Andrew! Can you please help clarify something that has been coming up a lot for us? I've looked through the posts, but I haven't seen this particular clarification. Sorry if you've already answered this.<br/><br/>----------------------------<br/>From the first page FAQ - Weapon rule 12. If a ship starts its move within Range 1 of an enemy's Cloaked Mine, does it take damage when it moves this turn?<br/><br/>This works the same as the normal rules for a Minefield Token (see p. 23), just with a wider range. If the ship moves beyond the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it does not receive damage again this turn. But if it stays within the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it is does receive damage again this turn.<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Page 23 of the book states "when a ship executes a maneuver in which either the <b>maneuver template</b> or the ship's base physically overlaps a minefield token, this triggers the text of whichever card placed the minefield token in the play area."<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Scenario question: The cloaked mines are placed and a ship enters their influence and takes the hit. The ship does not manage to leave the range 1 influence of the cloaked mines. Next turn, when this ship moves, it's maneuver template will still have originated in range 1 of the cloaked mines, but the ship manages to move outside of the mines influence. Do they still take a hit from the cloaked mines as they leave it's influence?<br/><br/>According to page 23 of the book, the ship would take a second hit. But FAQ12 seems to state that they won't. Can you please clarify which one is correct?</div>

Actually... now that I re-read the card for the umpteenth time, it is not reducing "hits" to a single hit but "damage" to a single (hit symbol). rolled hits and crits aren't damage until evade rolls/tokens have been compared to dice, right? They're just rolls until they get through?</div>

The IG changes the results to 1 damage then you may cancel it as normal. Look at the 1st page of this thread. It is the second question under tech upgrades.</div>

They only have the option of taking the actions on the captain card, and cannot be used to do anything on the ship (i.e. Sulu, Scotty, Re-enable a disabled upgrade).</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Nope. Ships take actions, not Captains. Gul Dukat specifically says 'Your ship may preform a Battlestations or Evade Action as a free Action.'</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Fair point, but Picard does not...<br/>"Each Round, you may perform one of the following actions as a free action.

Since the Flagship effectively adds an Action to the ship's Action Bar, it allows the Enterprise to perform the added Action even while under Auxiliary Power.<br/><br/>It is true that it is the ship that performs the Action, but in this case it is a question of the source of that Action. The intention of the Enterprise's ability is that it allows you to perform one of its native Ship Actions under dire circumstances. Therefore, when an Action is derived from its Action Bar (including one added to its Action Bar by the Flagship), then it can be performed while under Auxiliary Power. Picard does not add his Action to the ship's Action Bar, and that is why the ship cannot perform one of Picard's bonus Actions while under Auxiliary Power. This is how the Enterprise and Picard have interacted since the game released.<br/><br/>I understand Paul's argument, as he is focusing on the words "listed on" and taken literally, his argument has merit. However, (and please forgive this somewhat Clintonian explanation), it's all in how you define "listed" in this case. In this case, the intention of the word "listed" is that the Action is coming from the Ship's Action Bar and not another source. I understand the other interpretation as well, but this is why we have FAQ's, so that ambiguous text can be given a final clarification.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>  To be honest I do not understand the logic on Ships and actions as it stands.  Especially when "literally" reading the card makes you wrong.  This thus requires that both parties read this post and understand it.  I prefer the more cut and dry "letter of the law" and thus while unintended Picard's abilites work on the Constitution Enterprise.  This concept of action coming from things other ships is really confusing.      <br/><br/>For example if I use Romulan Pilot what is the sorce of the free scan action.  Is it the ship or is it the crew member.  Do crew action count against ships actions.<br/><br/>I wish that all actions were were ruled as coming from the ship no matter what and thus Picard would be able to use his action on the Constitution Enterprise.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>I don't see where the confusion is. First a ship can perform one action per turn (unless it has free actions). The action can either be the ship itself, or upgrades on that ship can instead perform their actions.<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>The USS Enterprise can perform an Action listed on its Action Bar while it has an Auxiliary Power token.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>This means that the Enterprise allows you to perform an action while you have an Auxiliary Power token if it comes from the SHIP performing and ACTION from its ACTION BAR. Now Picard is something altogether different.<br/><br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Each round you may perform one of the following actions as a free action: [EVASIVE] [TARGET LOCK] [SCAN] [BATTLESTATIONS]. You may use this action even if your ship does not have it in the Action bar. </i></div></div></font><br/><br/>First the card visually gives you what looks like a action bar and if that is not enough of a clue it states on the card that you may perform these actions in spite of them not being on your ships action bar. This indicates that this is not the ships action bar. <br/><br/>So to clarify my point "The USS Enterprise" read no further this is the subject of the sentence, what can the subject do "can perform an Action listed on its Action Bar" when can it do this "while it has an Auxiliary Power token". <br/><br/></div>

Then I do not understand why it is called damage then. Uncancelled hits aren't called damage until step 7 (page 14 at bottom right), and this IG card says its converting damage, so using this card rewinds you back to step 6 somehow... unless there is something I am missing as to why the wording on IG is ignored.</div>

Ah, ok...understood now.  <br/><br/>Anything that modifies the attack dice is done before the roll of the Defense dice, we had this arguement in X-Wing as well.<br/><br/>Roll the Attack, all modifications are done, including those from the defending player (if any).<br/><br/>Roll the defense dice, all modifications are done, including those from the attacking player (if any).<br/><br/>So, if the player does not evade the last hit and it was done with Quantum torps, then you get to add the additional hit, since it is conditional that the ship be hit before the addition of additional hit.</div>

I actually play with this card and I always turn the attack into one damage, and would take and extra if someone was using quantum torpedoes, but that is just me.<br/></div>

Hello,<br/><br/>Some friends and I are looking for clarification about just how many attack dice can be produced by a Barrage of Fire.<br/><br/>Here's the card text:<br/><br/><i>Secondary Weapon, SP Cost 5, Attack Dice 4, Range 1-2, Faction: Klingon<br/> <br/>ATTACK: Discard this card to perform this attack. Target 1 friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship. Target ship may not make a normal attack this round. Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack. Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside both ships.<br/></i><br/>Additionally, FAQ question 14 has this to say:<br/><br/><i>If a ship's attack is increased in some way, does this also boost its "Primary Weapon Value" for purposes of the Barrage of Fire?<br/><br/>No. Use the ship's printed "Primary Weapon Value." This can only be increased if the ship becomes your Flagship (OP Month 4).</i><br/><br/>The way I read the card, "target ship" and "that ship" refer to the ship supporting the barrage. It only uses its Primary Weapon value, with no bonus attack dice. Question 14 clarifies that if this ship is a flagship, however, it can apply its attack bonus from that.<br/><br/>In my understanding, none of this has anything to do with the ship initiating the barrage, since it's not using its primary weapon. I haven't found anything that seems to indicate the initiating ship would not add its own bonus attack dice to the barrage. So, for example, if a Vor'cha Class ship with Captain Kurn and a flagship card uses Barrage of Fire, it could contribute 6 attack dice (4 for Barrage of Fire +1 if it uses Kurn's ability +1 for the flagship card), plus 1 more, let's say, for being within Range 1 of Donatra. A supporting Vor'cha with Christopher Hobson that's also within Range 1 of Donatra would only add another 5 attack dice to the barrage.<br/><br/>A friend of mine sees things differently. He contends that the limitations on attack dice apply to <b>both</b> ships, so that neither would get any bonus attack dice except from a flagship card.<br/><br/>What's the consensus on this? And while we're on the subject of Barrage of Fire, would a ship be able to forego its attack in order to support a barrage later in the round?<br/><br/>Thanks!</div>

So if the ship using BoF is within range 1 of Donatra, you get the additional attack die, or you can use a Battlestations token to convert hits. You cannot, however, use tokens or any additional dice that the supporting ship has access to. Also, I believe it was answered earlier that a ship can forego an attack to support a later BoF.</div>

I'm pretty sure that a flagship using the Barrage does NOT get the +1. Flagship changes your ships printed attack value, which matters for the supporting ship but not for the ship actually using the Barrage card.<br/></div>

I see in the FAQ the following two rulings:<br/><br/>- 'Romulan pilot' adding a scan token to a ship doesn't count as 'taking a scan action', so the ship can still take its scan action as normal and end up with two 'scan' tokens.<br/><br/>- Command tokens: 'scan' adding a scan token to a ship DOES count as 'taking a scan action' (although a "free" one), so the ship CANNOT take its normal scan action and end up with two 'scan' tokens (as you cannot take two actions of the same kind in a turn, even if one is "free")<br/><br/>My question is - what is the nuance to the wording that provides these rulings?<br/><br/>I'm looking at the cards in question, and I don't really see what it is.  Can someone point out the difference, which indicates one is a 'free scan action', and the other is just a 'free action' that yields a scan token but ISN'T a 'free scan action'?<br/><br/><div><img border=0 src="http://i588.photobucket.com/albums/ss326/xan_fulton/scanactions.jpg"></div><br/><br/>Halp?</div>

(Previous ruling by Andrew)<br/><br/>5. you should almost always have the BofF fired from a ship with Drex or N'Garen, so that all of your  results get "upgraded" to critical/hit results!<br/><br/>Enjoy,<br/>Tom<br/><br/></div>

But the actions for the Command Tokens, Romulan Pilot and normal Scan action aren't the same.<br/><br/>1.Scan Action: place a Scan token by your ship<br/><br/>2.Command Token: place a Scan token by your ship<br/><br/>3.Romulan Pilot: place a Scan token by your ship AND take a green maneuver if you want to.<br/><br/>1 & 2 are the same so you can't do both in the same round.<br/><br/>1 & 3 are different so you can do both (even if you decide not to use the extra green maneuver).<br/><br/></div>

Hey guys, I'm trying out some funky builds and I had two questions: <br/><br/>Question 1: Would Alexander's ability trigger off the Kraxon taking damage from another friendly ship?<br/><br/>Kraxon: Whenever a friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship receives damage, you may transfer any amount of that damage to your own shields if possible.<br/><br/>Alexander: Each time your ship is hit for at least 1 damage, place 1 Battlestations token on this card. During the activation phase, you may take 1 Battlestations token off this card and place it beside your ship. <br/><br/>Question 2: If a ship uses Projected Statis Field and is later used as the secondary ship in a Barrage of Fire Attack, would it still lend its full attack value to the BOF attack since PSF doesn't affect the primary weapon value?<br/><br/>Projected Statis Field: If your ship is not cloaked, disable all of your remaining Shields and discard this Upgrade to target a ship at Range 1-2. That ship must disable all of its remaining Shields and cannot attack this round. Your ship rolls 2 less attack dice this round.<br/><br/>Barrage of Fire: Discard this card to perform this attack. Target 1 friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship. Target ship may not make a normal attack this round. Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack. Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs. Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside both ships.</div>

I would say no since the Kraxon technically isn't being "hit" it's just transferring damage. The reason why cards like Counter Attack work with the Kraxon's ability is because Counter Attack says nothing about "hits" -- it triggers when a ship is "damaged." <br/><br/>2.  All Barrage cares about is the printed attack value, so the ship would still contribute the full attack.  </div>

Thomas, while we all appreciate your dilligence, I'm concerned that giving the same unconfirmed answer in two different threads to the same person and question is going to start giving other players the wrong impression.

'Do I have at least one scan token beside my ship?  If yes, defender rolls 1 less die.'<br/><br/>Is that correct?  Rules-as-written, it's just a binary check regarding that defense die modification*?  Or should those have been written in such a way that the number of tokens stack?<br/><br/>*FWIW, even if it is just a binary check, I can still see value in having multiple tokens.  You may want to 'spend' a token to trigger 'Long Range Tachyon Scan', which forces the enemy to roll 2 less defense dice.  And then you'd still have another [scan] token left next to your to modify their defense roll even further.  The question is just whether multiple [scan] tokens has a stacking impact <i>on their own</i>.  Rules SEEM to say 'no', but...</div>

Next question: I don't see a problem with these stacking, but just to be sure...<br/><br/>Toreth (or anyone with en elite talent) + 'Engage' + Romulan Pilot in a Valdore + "Romulan flagship".<br/><br/>'Engage':<br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Action: If you performed a Green Maneuver this round, you may immediately perform an additional Green Maneuver of your choice.

If you do so, you may immediately make an additional Green Maneuver.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>And, of course, the Romulan-faction flagship gives you 'sensor echo' as a free action on ships that already have it (like, say, the Valdore).<br/><br/>SOOOO...I plot a 4-forward, and move that.  Now up to step 5 of the activation phase and before the step 6 'action' - I discard 'Romulan Pilot' and move my ship a 2-bank (a green maneuver for the Valdore).  I then take 'sensor echo' as my <i>free</i> action from the 'flagship' card and jump sideways.  Then, for my ship's selected action, I take 'Engage' (I've "performed a green maneuver this round" thanks to the Romulan Pilot), and take another 2-bank while picking up an aux power token for my troubles.<br/><br/>I don't see any issues with that sequence, but just wanted to verify it looked legal.</div>

Subtracting two dice from the support ship has no practical effect since the support ship isn't actually rolling dice during this attack.

The ship is always performing the action, not the captain or the upgrades.<br/><br/>However, in regard to the TOS Enterprise, what disqualifies Picard's action is that he is the source of the action that the ship is performing, not the ship's Action Bar.

Page 19 references Aux Power, stating that a Aux Power token is removed after executing a Green Maneuver, but it then points back to Step 4 of page 9.<br/><br/>4 - No. The second attack involves the Secondary Torpedo Launcher, and is separate from the first attack.<br/><br/>5 - Yes.

To summarize pages 71 & 72 of the FAQ:<br/><br/>The wording on Interphase Generator sucks. We know this. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/laugh.gif" alt="laugh"><br/><br/>I agree 100% that the word "damage" should not have been used on this card. Consider the word dragged out to the curb and beaten thoroughly with a stick.<br/><br/>We freely admit that the wording on some of the cards is ambiguous, and that is why rule on them in the FAQ.<br/></div>

Can you please help clarify something that has been coming up a lot for us? I've looked through the posts, but I haven't seen this particular clarification. Sorry if you've already answered this.<br/><br/>----------------------------<br/>From the first page FAQ - Weapon rule 12. If a ship starts its move within Range 1 of an enemy's Cloaked Mine, does it take damage when it moves this turn?<br/><br/>This works the same as the normal rules for a Minefield Token (see p. 23), just with a wider range. If the ship moves beyond the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it does not receive damage again this turn. But if it stays within the Cloaked Mine's Range, then it is does receive damage again this turn.<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Page 23 of the book states "when a ship executes a maneuver in which either the <b>maneuver template</b> or the ship's base physically overlaps a minefield token, this triggers the text of whichever card placed the minefield token in the play area."<br/>-----------------------------<br/>Scenario question: The cloaked mines are placed and a ship enters their influence and takes the hit. The ship does not manage to leave the range 1 influence of the cloaked mines. Next turn, when this ship moves, it's maneuver template will still have originated in range 1 of the cloaked mines, but the ship manages to move outside of the mines influence. Do they still take a hit from the cloaked mines as they leave it's influence?<br/><br/>According to page 23 of the book, the ship would take a second hit. But FAQ12 seems to state that they won't. Can you please clarify which one is correct?</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Adam, the reference to the Maneuver Template is referring to when the ship first comes into contact with the Minefield. For example, if a ship flies <b>through</b> the Minefield (only touching it with the Maneuver Template), then it still takes damage.<br/><br/>To answer why it doesn't take damage when leaving the Minefield, refer to the following paragraph on page 23 (extrapolating the reference to the Minefield Token to include the entire Cloaked Minefield):<br/><br/>"IMPORTANT: When overlapping a Minefield Token, the ship stays where it lands (on top of the token). When the ship moves on its next turn, it may separate from the Minefield Token without penalty."</div>

Since it's been established that a ship can perform a scan action and place a scan token as a free action. <br/><br/>1.) Is there a limit to how many of the same token can be placed as a free action? <br/><br/>2.) If a ship places a scan token as free action with Captain Janeway, can it place another scan token as a free action by discarding Romulan Pilot during the same turn.<br/><br/>3.)

Couldn't figure out how to post in the FAQ so I had to reply to a post. This mainly deals with Suicide Attack but some other questions too.<br/><br/>So I played the "First Battle of Chin'toka" (the mission that comes with the Jem'hadar fighter) with a friend and had a couple questions.<br/><br/>1) You have to use "Suicide attack" card in the mission, but my friend had "Projected Stasis Field" and a lower captain skill so he could use PSF before Suicide Attack. <br/>*PSF states "Action: If your ship is not cloaked, disable all of your remaining shields and discard this Upgrade to target a ship at Range 1-2. That ship must disable all of it's remaining Shields and cannot attack this round. Your ship rolls 2 less attack dice this round." <br/>*Suicide attack - "Action: At the end of the Activation Phase, you must make a 1 (straight) maneuver and place an Auxilliary Power Token beside your ship. If your ship overlaps an enemy ship, destroy your ship and roll 8 attack dice to damage the enemy ship. That ship rolls defense dice against this attack. This Upgrade may only be purchased for a Jem'Hadar ship. <br/>Suicide Attack is an Action, but it also constitutes an attack (because you roll 8 attack dice). <br/><u><b>Does the PSF upgrade block the Suicide Attack action?</b></u><br/><br/>2) One of my Dominion ships in this battle had the "Breen Aide" which with a scan token converts one blank result to a hit. As an action I used Scan, and attacked successfully with the Energy Dissipator, which meant I got another attack. <br/><b>Can the Breen Aide text be used for multiple attacks by the same ship, and the scan gives -1 defense against every attack as well? (also useful for Counter Attack)</b><br/><br/>3) <b>When using your second attack after the Energy Dissipator, does the defending ship get to roll defense dice?</b><br/><br/>4) My friend had Worf - "Action: Target a ship at Range 1. That ship rolls 2 less attack dice this round." <br/><b>This can be used against weapon cards like Energy Dissipator and Photon torpedoes right?</b></div>

Hey everyone!<br/><br/>So I don't know if this was posted or asked, but I have a question about the United Forces Admirals Orders-- which is:<br/><br/>If I have Pike on a ship, can those 10SP of upgrades be brought down by 1 point onto his ship if they're Crew Upgrades? For example:<br/><br/>My first Upgrade Card is Dimitri Valtane on Pike (2SP)<br/>Second Upgrade Card is Hikaru Sulu on Pike (2SP)<br/>So on and so forth...<br/><br/>I know this sounds cheesy, but Pike says "All of your Crew Upgrades Cost -1 Squadron Point." So was just wondering!<br/><br/>Drew</div>

Question: (sorry if this was already asked, I looked quite a bit before posting this and didn't see it)<br/>As it was ruled that the flagship card does not add the plus one damage to Enterprise D's special ability (which is a primary weapon attack with a declared attack value) then I assume that it is not a "+1 dice" of the type of donatra/scotty/etc.<br/>In this case, is the flagship card modifying the "printed attack value" of the primary weapon of the ship?  If not, what exactly is it doing?<br/>Point being: if a flagship with a "+1 attack" assists another ship firing "barrage of fire" does it assist with the base attack value or the base +1 value? (IE if a chtang fires bof with a vorcha flagship assisting does the attack roll 9 or 10 dice, all else being equal).<br/>Thank You very much!!!!</div>

So if you have a basic ship with an elite captain, odds are you can only have 1 elite talent at any given time.  You could use something like once more unto the breach (discard to use), and the next turn use your resource sideboard to move another elite talent down, but you can't have 2 of them there if there's not 2 slots available.<br/><br/>If you put Kirk on a flagship card that also give an elite talent, you could put 3 elite talents on him!  3x cheat death + suicide attack seems about right.  <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/smile.gif" alt="" border="0"></div>

I think  I understand what you are saying.  <br/><br/>If you had Kirk on a ship with two elite talents and then you sideboarded him out for another Captain that only had a single elite talent skill, what happens to the two elite talents on the ship?<br/><br/>My guess would be that you would have to choose one of the Elite talents to discard immediately as the new captain only has a single elite talent slot.<br/><br/>Andrew will have to provide the definitive answer as this is a tricky one and not a consequence that I think they intended. </div>

Andrew I have a follow-up question on Independent Flagship 1's ability:<br/><br/>After your Flagship moves, you may target 1 other friendly ship within range 1 of your Flagship. Target ship immediately performs a 2nd action listed on its action bar as a free action this round.<br/><br/>1.  If Kirk is on the flagship and Picard is on the friendly ship, would Picard still be able to take a second action listed on his ship's action bar if he already has taken his normal action and his personal free action?  Basically does his personal free action come from the ship or him?<br/><br/>2.  Similar scenario, but the friendly ship has taken its normal action and has been given a free action from Command Tokens.  Can it still take a second action from the flagship?</div>

I noticed adding an independent flagship card gives that ship both it's original faction and independent status. Do faction flagship cards also confer faction status? For example: Klingon flagship card on a fed ship becomes both Klingon and Federation?</div>

However an independent can be place on any ship and it gives that ship a dual faction status where both it's original faction and independent can be placed on the ship.</div>

Can Varel or Conditional Surrender cancel a direct attack from Antimatter Mines? If so, what happens to the mines?<br/><br/>"Discard this card to cancel a single attack against her ship before any dice are rolled."<br/><br/>"Attack: Discard this card and place a Minefield Token in your rear firing arc at Range 1. If you place this token on a ship, or if a ship enters the minefield, roll 4 attack dice. Any [DAMAGE] or [CRITICAL] damages the ship as normal.

If your ship overlaps an enemy ship, destroy your ship and roll 8 attack dice to damage the enemy ship. That ship rolls defense dice against this attack. This Upgrade may only be purchased for a Jem'Hadar ship.<br/><br/><br/>"Question" 2: How do you resolve multiple suicide attacks? can a ship be killed by an enemy suicide attack before it can complete it's own suicide attack?

Some questions about antimatter mines.<br/><br/><b>1. </b>I know you must drop so at least part of the template is within range 1 of the attacking ship.

So, if you drop it so that it is partially within range 1 of your ship but actually hits a ship at range 2, can you use the following flagship ability? <br/><br/>"All other friendly ships within range 1 of your flagship gain +1 attack when attacking at range 2-3."<br/><br/><br/><b>2. </b>I know battle stations does not work (too bad!).  But, does Boheeka's ability work? Seems like it might since it is a passive ability (i.e., you don't actually have to spend the token to use it).<br/><br/>"If your ship has a battle station token besides it when you attack, you may convert 1 blank result into one hit result."<br/><br/><br/><b>3. </b>How does interphase generator work with antimatter mines?  IPG says, "when defending while you are cloaked..."  AMM says "the affected ship does not roll any defense dice." But, AMM never mentions the defending ship (and it is not really defending in any meaningful way).<br/><br/><br/><b>4. </b>How does AMM work with other ships and crew that let you reroll attack dice.  I know target lock can't be used, but what about the Ch'Tang's ability (and similar abilities) which reads:<br/><br/>"If you initiate an attack while cloaked, you may choose any number of your attack dice ad re-roll them once."

EDIT: ignore question 1, found it after digging through old threads.<br/><br/>For context: I'm compiling rulings for the U.S.S. Defiant: <br/>"When defending, convert all your opponent's [crit] results into [hit] results."<br/><br/>As a second question: can you use the Defiant's ablity if it gets attacked by your own minefield?

For Christmas I got you a question about the OP5 resource, Mr. Parks.<br/><br/>If an attack squadron is hit for, say, 3 damage, and I choose to use the ability of a friendly Kraxon within range 1, how much damage is there to be transferred?  Does the ability of the attack squadron reduce it to 1, or would I have to take all 3 to the Kraxon to avoid removing a token from the Attack Squadron?<br/><br/>Attack Squadron Resource:<br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Attack squadrons are treated like normal ships... <br/><br/>...When an attack squadron sustains damage to its hull, do not draw damage cards as normal.  Instead remove one token from the top of the stack.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Kraxon:<br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>Whenever a friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship receives damage you may transfer any amount of that damage to your own Shields, if possible.</i></div></div></font></div>

If the Attack Squadron is about to be hit for say 3 damage, it isn't reducing the damage to 1.  It says that regardless of the amount of damage, you just remove one token.  It's still hit for 3 damage, so using the Kraxon may actually hurt more (it would have to take three damage for the Attack Squadron not to take any) unless you really want to keep the Attack Squadron on its 6 attack token.<br/><br/>Hopefully though Andrew can clarify if this is how it works.  </div>

You used the word "tie" when referring to a battle. There is no such thing as a "tie" on a single-battle basis. There is always a winner and a loser.<br/><br/>Fleet points are not determined by who destroyed the most. They are determined by what the opponent has left (which, in the case of total mutual destruction, both players would have 100 fleet points). <br/><br/>This is a moot point however. Fleet points do not replace the standard victory condition. The winner is still determined by page 17 of the rule book in this case to determine who gets the battle point. It is possible to win a game and have fewer fleet points than the opponent due to special secondary conditions.</div>

That leaves the capacity for scoring fleet points via objectives like attacking SFHQ or having troops on a planet, and then if still tied, the standard tie breaker roll off.</div>

Andrew,<br/><br/>I tried searching both the FAQ and the rules on Cloaked Mines, but cannot seem to locate the answer. <br/><br/>What exactly does it mean when the cloaked mines says "Enemy ship PASSES" within range one?? <br/><br/>Example, I have a ship that is outside he range one, my opponent has put down a minefield, my ships maneuver does go through the minefield, but when the ship does it's actual move, it is not in the range one (let's say a hard 3 turn). Since the ship only follows the template if there is a collision, I would say nothing happens, but I'm not sure about that word "PASSES". <br/><br/>Thank you for all the help and if this has been answered before please forgive the question. <br/><br/></div>

"Passes within" means any portion of your movement template, just as if your movement template overlapped any other obstacle. So if part of your movement template falls within range 1 of the mines, you take the hits since you passed over their area of effect.</div>

Hey Andrew!<br/><br/>Once again here with a question!<br/><br/>I'm trying to practice for OP5, and we're all unsure about whether or not Admiral's Orders are legal-- as the only set of Admiral's Orders is for January... and unless people are late with OP4, there IS no OP tourney in January!<br/><br/>So are the Admiral's Orders legal for Feb's OP5? Or are they not (as they'll be getting replaced?)<br/><br/>This would help I and my Play group so much if we know they're legal or not!<br/><br/>Thanks again for all your help, and I hope you had a great holiday!<br/><br/>Drew</div>

Thanks, Drew. The plan is to have a revised set of Admiral's Orders every month, so things will definitely be at least a little different in February. It is possible that some of the existing Admiral's Orders will remain, but they may be adjusted based on player feedback.<br/><br/>The thing to remember with Admiral's Orders is that player feedback is key. We need to know how they are affecting the environment, if something seems imbalanced, etc.<br/><br/>We look forward to hearing how they fare throughout the month of January.<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

OK, I have a very basic question. Sorry.<br/><br/>It came up while I was teaching a couple new players. <br/><br/>Ship is cloaked. I cannot acquire target lock but, can a card like EMP, that says target a ship at r1-r2, be used? Is 'target' when used like this simply the process of taking aim and not related to the ability to target lock?<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/></div>

This seems more like a "Permit" card and a "Permit More" card. Since it can't normally sensor echo, being able to is a bonus. If it said "you may sensor echo, you can not use a template other than 1 [straight]" (as awkward as that sounds) That would be more in line with the wording of a "forbid" effect. It is of course up to the intent of the designers though since its all semantics. </div>

I have a couple of questions related to the card Conditional Surrender.<br/><br/>Conditional Surrender: "When your ship is attacked, before any dice are rolled, discard all of your [Crew] Upgrades to cancel the attack.

If I use conditional surrender to cancel an attack can the attack be redirected to a different target?<br/><br/>My thought on 1 is that the attack can not be redirected. If an attack is cancelled then it is cancelled period. It would be like a missfire or systems failure in the attack. <br/><br/>I have a couple of follow on questions regards this card's interaction with secondary weapons. <br/><br/>Barrage of Fire: "ATTACK. Discard this card to perform this attack. Target 1 friendly ship within Range 1 of your ship. Target ship may not make a normal attack this round. Instead, add the Primary Weapon value of that ship to your attack roll for this attack. Both ships must have the enemy ship within their forward firing arcs. Place an Auxillary Power Token beside both ships."<br/><br/>2. If the BoF Attack is cancelled is the Attacker still required to:<br/><br/>2a. Discard BoF, <br/>2b. The assisting ship can not make a normal attack, and <br/>2c. Both ships get an Auxillary Power Token?<br/><br/>My thought on 2 is yes because the cancellation happens before dice are rolled which indicates that the pre-requisite discarding / no attack / and Auxillary Power Tokens to enable the attack still occur.<br/><br/>3. likewise with other secondary weapons such as Torpedos (Pick a flavour) would the discarding of the target lock and disabling of the secondary weapon still occur?<br/><br/>Edit: I am asking these questions because they either have or will likely come up during games. i have my thoughts but I would prefer an official ruling, I wouldn't want to short change some one during an event.<br/><br/><br/><br/></div>

FYI: Based on player feedback, Chris and I have discussed the interaction of the Rav Laerst and Synon, and we have concluded that the Rav Laerst's restriction "forbids" the Rav Laerst to use anything but a 1 Straight template when performing a Sensor Echo with its special ability, and according the rules on page 18, that would not allow the Rav Laerst to benefit from Synon.<br/><br/>We've updated the front page of the FAQ with this ruling.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Andrew</div>

This came up in a game last night, but never ended up needing a ruling at the time (the play chose to do something else), still it begs a clarification. <br/><br/>What happened: A player wanted to use Barrage of Fire, but both the ships involved (the Barrager and the targeted friendly ship) had just performed red "come about" maneuvers and had Aux Power tokens. Obviously the secondary attack was legal because it wasn't an action, but it would have given both ships a SECOND aux power token. We all know that you can by some combinations of effects get two tokens... but can you bring them on yourself? Which is to say if you can't take two red maneuvers in a row, can you take a red maneuver and then an action to gain an Aux token? <br/><br/>Also we did rule that in that case you have to take TWO green maneuvers to clear both Tokens... is that correct? <br/><br/>I'm not sure if any card text is needed here other then mentioning that the BOF gives both ships an Aux Power token, but I'm happy to fetch the text if you like. </div>

So there are a couple of ways for ships to get multiple scan tokens. Can a ship with multiple scan tokens use multiple cards that trigger off of scan tokens?<br/><br/>Example:<br/>A ship has Spock and Dimitri Valtane. During a turn, this ship somehow gets two scan tokens. Can Spock trigger off of the first and Dimitri off of the second scan token?<br/><br/>The ruling (pg22 of rulebook) is this:<br/>"Only one upgrade card on each ship can trigger its ability from the same token during the same round"<br/><br/>This reads to me like it would be legal to use two upgrade cards where each one triggers off of a different scan token. I haven't been able to find an answer for this. Maybe I'm just using the wrong terms.</div>

OP 6 questions regarding the NOR class station.<br/><br/>OP rules state that the station's secondary weapons aren't in effect for the OP. But that is for an uncontrolled station.<br/><br/>If part of my build is to equip the Reinforcements Sideboard and I take Quantum Torpedoes as my sideboard weapon resource, can I equip that onto DS9 if I have control of the station?<br/>And if so equipped, can I then use them to fire from the pylons or hub?<br/><br/>Same question for A/M mines. Would I be able to equip the station with the A/M mines and if so, can I then deploy it from either the pylon or hub?<br/><br/>Finally, for purposes of the cloaked minefield, does the station act as a 'ship' for mine laying restriction purposes? Or simply as an obstacle?<br/>In other words, can I place cloaked mines closer than Range 2?</div>

Captain and/or crew beams over to DS9 ...<br/><br/>assume it's Kirk, or Picard, or another captain with an elite talent upgrade ...<br/><br/>does the elite talent "go" with the captain to DS9?  or does it "stay" on a ship (which presumably then cannot use it as that ship is now treated as having a skill rank 1 captain)?<br/><br/>Thx and Happy New Year!<br/>Tom<br/><br/>Part 2 - flagship with Elite Talent, captain without ... captain beams over, same question - does the captain still "have" the elite talent or is it "left" with the flagship?  (in this case, the flagship presumably COULD use the elite talent, regardless of the skill rating of the "replacement" captain).<br/></div>

I have a couple of more antimatter mines questions.  I did a search and could not find the answers.  Sorry if i just missed them somehow.<br/><br/>1. If you drop an antimatter mine directly on two ships at the same time (because they are close together), do you get to roll the attack dice against both ships?  Seems the answer should be yes given how they work in general, but I wanted to double check to be safe.<br/><br/>2. Can antimatter mine tokens overlap? For example, if I have two ships with antimatter mines, can I drop them both so that there is some overlap?<br/><br/>3. If the answer to question 2 is yes, if a ship crosses the overlapping part of two antimatter mines tokens, do you roll two/both attacks against that ship?<br/><br/>4. Assuming the answer to all of the above is yes, if I have two ships with antimatter mines and they drop them so they overlap with two enemy ships in such a way that both mines overlap both ships, that would mean I would get to attack each ship twice, correct?</div>

One of my teammates pulled the craziest shenanigans on me today. I know it doesn't work but I just need to find out how many ways it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Flagship - "After your Flagship moves, you may target 1 other friendly ship within range 1 of your Flagship. Target ship immediately performs an extra white or green maneuver."<br/><br/>1a) Can this extra maneuver be given to someone who hasn't moved yet this round?<br/>1b) This follows the usual restrictions of "after you move" correct? i.e. even if the ship moves again due to romulan pilot, you don't activate it again. (I know it doesn't work but for some reason I couldn't find it on the front page of the faq).<br/><br/>2) Can you activate 2 different romulan pilots on the same ship in the same turn? (I swear this was asked somewhere but I can't find the answer now).<br/><br/>Cochrane Deceleration Maneuver "Action: If you performed a (1 forward) Maneuver this round, discard this Upgrade to Come About (reverse direction). Place an Auxiliary Power Token beside your ship."<br/><br/>3a) Can you perform a 1 [forward], do another movement (like from In'Cha or Romulan pilot) and then activate Cochrane Deceleration Manever after that? <br/>3b) Can you activate CDM later in a turn with an effect like "Martok"?<br/><br/>4) When a ship is moving, when is it determined to be outside the play area after it's revealed movement? If I do a turn and end up off of the play area, can I sensor echo back into the play area?<br/><br/>OP Tournament standing: There is some small contention that would be helpful with official ruling (if you can't give it, you'd know who could as the venue won't change it unless it's "official"):<br/><br/>5a) Admiral for a tournament is determined by Who won the tournament the previous month, or by currnet Cumulative Battle Points for the entire storyline OP?<br/>5b) Winning the DS9 at the end of OP6 is determined by Cumulative Battle Points for the entire storyline OP, or only considers who wins OP6?</div>

So I could see using two on consecutive rounds being allowed, but not in the same activation.<br/><br/>As soon as a ship base touches the outside of the play area, I believe it is considered to have left the field of play. The point at which you would check if it has left the play area would be immediately after the maneuver is completed in the movement step.<br/><br/>Insofar as CDM is concerned, I imagine that the intent is that the most recent maneuver performed this round is a 1 forward when you use the upgrade, although as to whether it may activate after some upgrade that allows an additional maneuver like In'Cha or Romulan Pilot I am not sure about.</div>

Regarding #2 above - You're saying that 'place a scan token beside your ship as a free action' (irregardless of source) counts as a distinct action that cannot be repeated?<br/><br/>Personally, I would have overruled it on an order of operations basis; once you've finished resolving the initial Romulan Pilot, it's too late to trigger a second one.</div>

Follow up question: Once you control it, is it considered a "friendly ship"?

Since the hub and pylons are treated as distinct "ships" for attacking purposes (as each one gets its own firing arc and attack), would you be able to fire with the hub/pylons that didn't participate in the Barrage, or would the Barrage's effect prevent the entire station from firing that round?<br/><br/>Thanks again!</div>

Gelnon<br/>Dominion Captain<br/>Action: Target an enemy ship in your forward firing arc withing Range 1 and immediately roll 2 attack dice.

I read it as you could either keep it enabled and disable it to prevent 1 normal damage from a minefield OR disable the card voluntarily to be able to roll defence dice against damage from mines.<br/><br/>Yours sounds more correct though.

There are a few actions in the upcoming set that add Aux-Power tokens to your ship. (There may be some already I'm just not thinking about...) <br/><br/>So if you use an action to get whatever ability or benefit and it gives you an Aux Token can you then not take any free actions after that because the Aux Token turns the rest of your actions off? <br/><br/>Or can you sneak out all your actions (because you started your action phase without the token) then then have the token to remove the next turn? <br/><br/>I'm not 100% clear I am explaining this question well... but there you go. </div>

For the united force admiral orders, can you spend your 10 points on a flagship resource? Is the definition of an upgrade any of the cards based on your tool bar, therefore the answer is no, or as it's the only resource so far which is assigned to a ship so counts as an upgrade too?</div>

OP tournament and a Tie.<br/><br/>How are ties handled in game rounds for an OP tournament?     My Last OP we had a complete tie with no ships destroyed at the end of the game time (1hr.)  <br/><br/>One player used a "Discard to perform action" card and the other player had damage done to one of their ships hulls but all ships were at full shields at the end of the match.<br/><br/>Should there be additional time awarded or should there be some sort of point setup for a dead heat tie?<br/><br/>Thanks in Advance!</div>

Searched the FAQ and Wiki, and didn't find an answer to this...<br/><br/>The rulebook (pg 11) gives the process for sensor echo as:<br/><font color=><div class='quote'><div class='quotebody'><i>A ship cannot perform a Senso Echo if this would cause its base to overlap another ship or similar obstruction. The player may measure to see if his ship can perform a Sensor Echo <b>before</b> committing to this action; he may even test both the [1 forward] and [2 forward] Maneuver Templates when making this determination. However, once he physically picks his ship off the playing surface, he must commit to the Sensor Echo Action unless doing so proves to be impossible without overlapping another ship or obstruction.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>...question is...what if, on picking up the ship and attempting to place it down, one finds that - in fact - it CANNOT be placed at the end of the '1' or '2' templates in that direction, after all?

I haven't seen this answer anywhere yet, and it came up in my last game. <br/><br/>If I overlap more than one ship with my suiciding ship, do I <br/><br/>1) Roll 8 dice for each ship I overlap?<br/>or<br/>2) Roll 8 dice one time and apply the results to each ship?<br/>or<br/>3) Roll 8 dice only against the first ship I overlap?<br/><br/>Personally I would say 1 or 2. If I can get multiple ships with that short movement through good positioning, I should be able to damage them all. (I got 3 under my base) </div>

The rule for "Unique Names" on page 21 of the rulebook states "a single player cannot field two or more cards that share the same unique name". I would assume that this does not appy to "Valdore" (captain) and "I.R.W. Valdore" (ship), right?</div>

Two effects cannot trigger off the same -token- (like [battle stations] or [scan], rulebook pg22). That is different. The same event can trigger as many things as possible (Like using Cheat Death and I Stab at Thee at the same time, they both have the same trigger as well).</div>

1) If an Upgrade card attached to a ship is face down via some effect (like Kirk), is it a valid target for assigning Disabled tokens, such as Miles O'Brien or Klingon Boarding Party?<br/><br/>2) If Kirk is Disabled, are any of his face down Elite Talents forcibly revealed?<br/><br/>3a) If Kirk is pulled off of a ship via Reinforcements Sideboard, are any of his ship's face down Elite Talents forcibly revealed?<br/><br/>3b) If another captain with an Elite Talent replaces Kirk, do the Talents remain face down, or are they revealed?<br/><br/>Klingon Boarding Party: "Action: If your ship is not Cloaked, disable all your remaining Shields and target a ship at Range 1-2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields.

So this one is a little complex, so please bare we me… <br/><br/>Recently I've been seeing a lot of talk about how dice can typically only be re-rolled one time. I.E. after the first re-roll they are normally locked. This all comes from text on page 14 of the rule book as follows: <br/><br/>"A die that has already been re-rolled cannot be re-rolled again during this attack unless a card effect specifically says a die can be re-rolled more then once." <br/><br/>I have always taken this to be the standard game "boiler plate" that means you can't say use the same Target Lock to re-roll dice over and over until you get a perfect result. Just like in the same paragraph is specifies that once you re-roll a die you must accept the new result, which is kind of a "duh" thing to point out, but every game has to, just in the same way it suggests here that if you can "re-roll as many dice as you want" from a roll this doesn't mean the same die more then once. <br/><br/>However it seems in the forums this has taken to meaning that even if two effects would apply to the same roll they can't both cause re-rolls. So for example: <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>If a Romulan player had the Romulan Flagship (on whatever) which gives attack re-rolls to the rest of your fleet, and his other ship was the named Aj'Rmr with its named ability (<font color='#FF0000'>Each time you attack, you may re-roll 1 of your attack dice for every damage card assigned to your ship.</font>) and it had some damage on it… it couldn't reroll dice more then once (from the two effects). <br/><br/>Or another example: <br/><br/>If you're firing against a Klingon ship with Koloth as its captain, and he used his ability (<font color='#FF0033'>Each time an enemy ship attacks you, you may force that ship to re-roll 1 attack die of your choice.</font>) to make one of your dice a miss… you couldn't then re-re-roll that die as part of your re-roll from say a discarded Target Lock. <br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I suppose I'm not necessarily married to either ruling on this, but it seems that if two unrelated effects both grant re-rolls it stands logically they should both work, and the rules on Page 14 are simply there to help new players not exploit one re-roll effect into dozens of re-rolls or whatever. <br/><br/>It does seem to be something we should be 100% clear on, as the amount of offensive and defensive re-roll effect are starting to pile up. <br/><br/>So while I am at it, here are two more questions (I'll start on #2 as I guess this was all a big question #1) - <br/><br/>#2: When does the re-roll effect of a dropped Target Lock take effect? I think we all tend to do it right after we fire (which I guess feels organic or something) but should it be held to the "attacker modifies dice" step, which is after the "defender modifies dice" step, or is it out on its own? <br/><br/>#3: As the defender modifies dice first, lets return to our example with Koloth (<font color='#FF0033'>Each time an enemy ship attacks you, you may force that ship to re-roll 1 attack die of your choice.</font>) Lets say you attack his ship and roll NO hits. As the defender Koloth's player has no real target for his effect… THEN you use a re-roll (lets just say from the Romulan Flagship for this example) and you end up with a few hits… the chance to re-roll a die for the defender has passed, so he <i><b>wouldn't</b></i> be able to then use his ability… is my interpretation… is that correct? <br/><br/>#3B: And on that subject… lets say you are shooting against the Defiant (<font color='#FF0033'>When defending, convert all your opponent's [crit] results into [hit] results.</font>) and you roll poorly, including no critical hits… as the defender modifies dice first, the Defiant's ability would trigger, THEN you would re-roll your attack dice (if you could by some effect) and if you then rolled critical hits the Defiant would be screwed yes? <br/><br/>I guess that's all I got. Sorry for the giant giant post. Just trying to really get a grip on the rules (both as a player and a sometimes judge of smaller casual events). Hope this all made some sense. </div>

#1 Each <i>individual </i>die can only be rerolled once. So in your example, say the Aj'rmr rolls 4 attack dice with results of crit battlestations, battlestations, miss. Koloth can make the Aj'rmr to reroll the crit die (defender modifies dice first) and it comes up a miss. The Aj'rmr can reroll the<i> other 3 dice</i> and accept those results. But that crit that became a miss can't be rolled again.<br/><br/>#2 That Target Lock reroll happens during the "attacker modifies dice" step. So if the attack roll is particularly good you don't have to spend the Target Lock. It also means <i>the attacker must choose to use the Target Lock or not for a reroll <b>before</b> the defender rolls any dice</i>. This can be advantageous for the defender.<br/><br/>#3 Correct. The defender has already had his chance to modify the dice and has passed. He can no longer affect those dice.<br/><br/>#3B Yes, same as #3.</div>

Romuln Pilot requires you to be able to take a free action. Since you cannot take any actions while you have a power token, the indirect answer is "no it doesn't work". If somehow you could use romulan pilot with a stress token, then yes it would remove a token.

Strictly speaking the rules just direct you to skip the perform action step, which would not itself prevent a ship from making actions outside its action step from Martok.

So I guess I need Andrew to clarify the Romulan Pilot.<br/><br/>1.) Can a ship perform a free action outside of its original activation? For example if a ship gets a second movement from a flagship card (a second opportunity to move) can it then get the ability from Romulan pilot as the ship moved again?<br/><br/>2.) If the above is no, can Martok (Lvl 8) then grant the ability to use a Romulan pilot after the flagship card gives it the ability to move seeing as the placing of a scan token is a free "action."<br/><br/>Thank you<br/><br/>*** Edit *****<br/><br/>Independent Flagship: "After your flagship moves you may target one friendly ship range 1 of your flagship. Target ship immediately performs a green or white maneuver."<br/><br/>Martok (lvl 8): "After you move, choose one friendly ship within range 1-2, whose captain has a lower skill then Martok's.

Engage and In'cha are both actions. That means these movements actually occur during step 6 "action step." This was the reason Romulan pilot had to be clarified. The problem is the Romulan pilot and the flagship both allow an additional movement outside of the action step, this means they don't follow normal rule book steps.</div>

That's why I'm asking.<br/><br/>I realise the intention may have been to read it the way you describe it.<br/><br/>However, given the way it is actually worded my example could be argued as correct.<br/><br/>Since the examples previously quoted used the command tokens and Picard (where the actions can also be listed on the action bar) it wasn't fully clear whether or not Actions which weren't listed on the Action Bar are included when determining what defines 2nd.<br/><br/>Hence my request for further clarification.<br/><br/>I'm happy either way I just think it needs a ruling to clarify.</div>

My buddy has Picard on the Enterprise-D with the Engage Elite Talent. Can he do a green move as his move, then one of the Picard listed actions for free, then another green maneuver using Engage, getting an aux token? Then next turn, do a green to remove the aux token, Picard free action, another green maneuver using Engage, ad naseum? We want to make sure that timing is correct. For some reason I though the turn you got an aux token you couldn't take any other actions, free or not, but this is a bit unusual for us.</div>

For some reason I though the turn you got an aux token you couldn't take any other actions, free or not, but this is a bit unusual for us.</i></div></div></font><br/><br/>Since you can take actions in the order you wish, this works fine. <br/><br/>You cannot perform any actions while you have the aux token, but as long as you take Picard's action before using Engage, you're good to go.</div>

Time expired with what we had left. Who would win in this scenario? The wording in the Battle Points led me to believe that it would be J. The wording in Fleet Points led another to believe R. Which one is right?<br/><br/>Thank you for addressing us!<br/></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>The correct answer is that it is impossible to know because neither of your designated where you spent your United Force points. Those 10 points are not scored, which means even if they survived the game they don't count as points alive in the calculation. And the calculation is not what's dead, its 100 minus what's alive.<br/><br/>If J's UF points were all spent on its Enterprise upgrades instead of the Excelsior, then K scored 54 points (100 minus [28 + 6 + 2 + 5 + 5]).<br/><br/>But if J's UF points were all spent on Excelsior upgrades (which died anyway), then K scored only 44 points (100 minus [28 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 5]).<br/><br/>Similarly, J's points could swing by up to 10 points based on where K's UF force points were spent.<br/><br/>So it is impossible to know who won due to poor record keeping, which happened because of lack of understanding of United Force and scoring. If everyone had been verifying build totals with initials then it is possible that someone at the event would have recognized this problem and corrected one of you, then one of you could have corrected the other person when verifying before the final game. Remember this is a game about navies, so paperwork is important. <img src="http://cf.geekdo-static.com/images/tongue.gif" alt="" border="0"></i></div></div></font><br/><br/>The UF points aren't scored???? Is that on the FAQ page? I couldn't find it quickly last Sunday when looking at the "pocket" version on my phone. We ended up just scoring them as regular points assigned to whatever ship. Someone using UF started at 110 - whatever was left, which meant they also lost initiative almost every time. Like I said, I couldn't find any mention of UF or the AOs in the FAQ. That should be fixed.</div>
